I don’t mean to please grand people.

With love friends’ notions I’d rate

And give you all that 1 could scribble

As pawn that’s worth of dear mate.

Its worth of fine and charming soul,

Of saint fulfilled generous dreams,

Of lively lucid verse’s glow,

Of lofty thoughts, of simple things.

All right, by hand unfair own

You take my set of florid rhymes

Which are half-funny and half-mournful,

Of common thinking, somewhat thoughtful,

Slipshod result of my pastimes,

Of sleepless nights, of inspirations,

Of years young but whithered hard,

Of mind some cold observations,

Of grievous notes of the heart.

CHAPTER ONE

He hurries up to live, As well as he does to feel.

K. Vyasemsky.

I

‘My uncle keeps to honest systems: By falling ill yet not in jest,

He made me love him with insistence And couldn’t find some better test.

Well, his example gives a lesson; But, goodness me, it’s quite distressing

To sit with him all day and night, Not stepping out of his sight.

And what insidiousness you show, When you amuse a man half dead

Arrange the pillows in bed Then give him drugs in sadness, though

You sigh not speaking of your will: When will the devil come for him!’

II

The young scapegrace was so deeming, When he by post-chaise in dust

Was shaking. Due to Zues he’s being The heir of all relatives in trust.

Ruslan’s, Lyudmila’s friends!

Somehow, Without prefaces, just now, For hero of my book Let me attract attentive look:

Onegin, friend of mine for years, Was born on Neva-river’s banks.

May be, you rose from the clans In those places, or have dears,

Somewhere you could look at me, But harmful is the North for me,

III

His father served for many years, And fell in debt, such big and vast,

That, giving balls three times a year, He squandered all he had at last.

But Eugene’s fate for him was fair: At first by Madame he was cared,

But then a frenchman took her place.

The boy was frisky but with grace.

Monsieur l’Abbe, a Frenchman mere, To give the boy some chance to rest,

Was teaching him with ready jest, With morals never was severe,

For pranks reproved with gentle talks, To Summer Garden took for walks.

IV

Insurgent youth is not yet endless. When Eugene was to change his sort

In times of hopes, tender sadness, Monsieur was driven from the court.

Onegin’s now free from care. In fashion has he cut his hair,

Like London dandy, well arrayed, First coming to the world he made.

His French was so perfect now, That he could chat, as well as write,

He was in dances quick and light, Without tension he could bow:

What more you want?

The world said: why, He is a clever, pretty guy.

V

We all to learn had little go And anyhow something got,

With education, as you know, We all can shine, and bless it God!

Onegin was in eyes of people, (Which were in judgements strict, not feeble,)

A pedant but of science man. He had a happy talent then:

He was enabled, slightly rushing, To speak of anything at once,

As real expert does by chance. He could be silent in discussion,

His epigram’s unwaited file Could make all pretty ladies smile.

VI

But Latin’s not in fashion now. To tell the truth but frank enough,

He knew the Latin anyhow: To talk about epigraf,

Of Jouvenale to talk much better, To end with vale own letter,

Remembered, though with mistakes, Two little verses of Enaid’s.

He never wished to rummage quickly In chronological thick dust

Of writings of the life in past, But ancient anecdotes deeply -

From Romul to the present day - In depth of mind he kept away.

VII

Not having any higher passion To rhymes to dedicate his life,

Iambus he, at frank confession, From trochee couldn’t tell meanwhile.

Feocrite, Gomer were reproved, Yet Adam Smith was well approved,

In house-keeping he was best Arid any problems put to test:

Of how state itself enriches, And how lives, which way and why

Without gold can revive While simple product is its richness:

His father didn’t understand Arid put in pledge the whole land,

YIII

To tell you all, what he had known, I haven’t any time at all.

His genius was unique, alone, He knew of something best of all,

Which was for him from time of childhood Like work and torment, was delightful,

Which pressed his spirits all the way And kept his laziness for day, -

It was the art of tender passion, By Nazon brightly glorified.

But Nazon was by world denied And suffered past rebellious session:

Moldavia, that’s far away From Italy, was end of way.

IX

………………….. 	………………….. 	…………………..

X

From early times he was dissembling, Some hidden hope he could leave,

He pined away, he was dissuading, Was dull and jealous, made believe;

Could come such proud or obedient, Could be attentive or indifferent;

Was languishing and taciturn, Eloquent ardently in turn;

In hearty letter, as its sender, He was slipshod.

For all of that

Of own life he could forget!

His look was always quick and tender,

Was impudent and shy; sometimes Could show how tear shines,

XI

Was seeming new on each occasion, With jokes innocence amazed.

Could give a fright by desperation, With flattery could draw one’s gaze,

Was able any glimpse of sweetness, Of vergin years bias giftness

With passion and the wit to gain, For sudden tenderness to wait,

For words of love to be entreating, First move of heart to catch by chance,

To chase the love and all at once To get agreed a secret meeting,

And then from people far away To give her lessons all the day?

XII

And how could he be annoying The hearts of ladies, whom he knew!

But when his thoughts were of destroying His own rivals, though few,

His scandal talks were such backbiting!

His nets for them were so frightening!

But blissful husband of coquette, To part from him you did regret!

By cunning husband he was greeted, Of Faublas previous a fan;

By one mistrustful old man; Him stately cuckold admitted,

Who’s always proud of himself, Of dinner and of wife herself.

XIII, XIV

………………….. 	………………….. 	…………………..

XV

Sometimes, when he’s in bed yet sleeping, Some papers they are bringing him.

What?

Invitations for a meeting?

Three houses will wait for him.

Some balls, one children’s entertainment...

What will he choose for his engagement?

With which to start?

In wonder style To every place he came in time.

Meanwhile he’s dressed for walk at morning, His bolivar he’s having on	{3]

And comes to bouieward quite forlone: He there at a space is walking

Until his breget sleepless, fine Will strike the bells for him to dine.

XVI

Its dark.

In sledge he’s sitting now. -Away, away! - the driver marks,

And, covered with the frosted gown, His beaver collar now sparks.

To Talon’s surely he’s raiding. Kaverin there is awaiting.

He comes: the corks for ceiling pass, The wine like comet splashes fast.

A bloody roast-beef is given, And truffles, splendour of teenage,

In France of cooking highest gauge; And pie train Strassburg, freshly driven,

Between the Limburg lively cheese And best pine-apple gold squeese.

XYII

The thirst demands some more of drinking To cool hot cutlet’s fat at once,

But breget bells are now clinking: New ballet will begin by chance,

Of theatre strict legislator, Inconstant adorer of later

Quite charming actresses, he is An honoured cityzen of links.

For theatre Onegin’s speeding. In it each man is free at all:

He may each entrechat catcall, Or hiss Moina, Fedra greeting;

Or Cleopatra may encore (By others to be heard once more).

XYIII

Enchanting land! In days of wisdom, Of satire great potentate,

Fonvizin shone, a friend of freedom, Knyazhnin was always up-to-date.

With Ozerov all were delighted, Semyonova with him divided

The tears of the people’s awe. Katenin there could restore

Of Corneille stately genius; there Was known prickly Shakhovskoy

Who wrote comedies with joy; With glory Didla’s crowned there.

And there, in the shades of links, My younger days were rushing things,

XIX

My goddesses’ what are you? where?

You listen to my grievous call:

Are you the same, or others dared To change, replace you there all?

Shall I again your chorus hear?

Of Russian Terpsichore’s dear

Shall see emotional flight?

Or dismal eye will never find

At boring stage some known actor, And, turning to unknown world

My disillusioned lornette, Of joy some careless spectator,

With yawn I’ll cover disrespect And shall of bygone recollect?

XX

Each box in theatre is shining, In pit each stall already boils,

In gallery the claps are flying, And rising curtain makes a noise.

Half-aireal and resplended, To magic bow all attended,

Istómina’s in front of pit, With nymths she waits to make a hit.

With one of feet the floor she’s touching, With other slowly she wheels,

Then sudden caper - and she fleets Like down from Eolus marching,

She makes her figure twine and twist, With quick her foot the foot she beats.

XXI

Each claps.

Onegin now enters, For stalls comes over the feet,

Lornette his double slantwise renders To see all ladies to be fit,

He cast a glance at ladies’ tires, At circles but with looks, attires

Was terribly unsatisfied. With every man at any side

He bowed. Unattending body, At stage he looked as if by chance,

Turned off, then yawned and said at once:

«It’s time to change them in a body,

Too long by ballets I was pressed, By Didle too I am depressed».

XXII

Yet Cupids, devils and the serpents Make noise and hop in front of pit;

Yet some of weary men-servants At entrance on fur-coals sleep;

Yet someone hisses, feet are stamping, Some blow nose, cough, are clapping;

Yet outside, as well’s inside, The lanterns everywhere shine;

Yet, being chilled, are striking horses, Annoyed by harness; near light

The drivers all themselves incite By clapping; each his master curses...

Onegin’s out by himself, He goes to redress himself.

XXIII

Shall I portray in truthful picture Secluded study of the best,

All fashioned model of the creature Who’s dressed, undressed, anew redressed.

All fancy goods for whims abundant Which are supplied by busy London

All over the Baltic waves For forest, fat and hand-made lace;

All things by Paris craft invented To help the idle hungry taste

The great prosperity lo waste - To have at home he intended:

Philosopher among his mates With them his room he decorates.

XXIV

Visantine tubes with amber, treasures Of bronze and porcelain of the past;

For coddled sense the best of pleasures: Perfume in bottles of cut glass.

Some files of steel for nails, some combs, Some scissors, straight and wry: he owns

For teeth the brushes, and for nails, Some thirty kinds for all avails.

Rousseau (I’d say as if bypassing), Of how dared pompous Grim

To brush his nails in front of him, Eloquent madcap, wasn’t grasping.

The knight of freedom and of right, In case like this he wasn’t right.

XXV

You may become a man of business And think of beauty of the nails.

With age to argue is unfitness; The custom’s despot of the males.

Like great Chadayev, Eugene dear Of jealousy reproach feared,

Was pedant, judging of the cloth, We’ll call him dandy for the forth.

At least three hours he daily In front of mirrors gladly spent,

And from his dressing room he went Like giddy Venus, when quite gaily,

In man’s attire all arrayed, The goddess comes to masquerade.

XXVI

The modern taste of his attire, To keep your curious gaze,

To meet the scholar world’s desire I could describe, you’d be amazed.

Of course, it would be so bold, Describing is what I must hold.

B By pantalones, frac, gillette - In Russian they are absent yet.

I now see, of it confessing, That even my such poor style

Yet might be less fulfilled for while By foreign words without pressing,

Yet long ago did I look For words in Academic Book.

XXVII

To other things let’s make approach: For ballet we shall hurry up.

To it headlong in simple coach Onegin now has sped up

In front of darkened silent homes, Along the sleepy streets in rows;

All double lanterns in the sight Are stretching their joyful light,

And make some rainbows on snow. By lampions dotted from the sides

A splendid house now shines, In windows some shades can flow,

Appear profiles of heads Of ladies and of fashion cranks.

XXVIII

My Eugene is in front of home. Hall porter shadfly he bypassed,

Up marble footsteps he has flown, With hand has mended hair fast.

Came in.

The hall is full of crowd; The music’s weary of sound;

Mazurka is the crowd’s choice; All round are crush and noise;

The spurs of horse-guards-man are jingling, Each foot of pretty ladies flies,

At their fascinating signs The flaming looks of men are fleeting.

Through roar of fiddles never thrives The jealous whisper of styled wives.

XXIX

In days of gaiety and wishes I could at ballets lose my wit;

It’s better place for passing letters fit.

Oh, you, the husbands so honoured!

To you I’ll give my service; forward You keep on mind my speech to you;

I’d like anew to warn all you: You, mothers, should be more severe,

While looking after girls, and yet At them keep strictly your lornette!

If not... if not, let God deliver!

I write it, as for long my time I haven’t any sin of mine.

XXX

Alas! for funs, which can be differed, I’ve ruined much of own life.

But if the morals never shifted, My love to ballets could survive.

I like teenage’s lively madness, The tightness, brightness and the gladness;

Of ladies well-considered dress. I love girls feet. But it’s a stress

To try to find in Russia whole Of them three pairs straight and fine.

Ah! I’ll forever keep in mind Small feet of lady.

Sad and cold,

I do remember them; in dream They trouble all my heart, such grim.

XXXI

In what a waste, when? where? how? You, madman. will all them forget?

Ah, feet, such small, where are you flow, What vernal plants are trampling yet?

In eastern comfort being cherished Sad northern snow to embellish.

You never stamped your small foot-prints. You liked smooth carperts of some prints

To touch in splendid admiration.

Is it high time as I forgot

For you the glory and the laud, The father’s land, incarceration?

But happiness of youth has gone Like light foot-prints in fields forlone.

XXXII

Diana’s breasts, the cheeks of Flora Delightful are, my freinds, you see!

But foot, such small, of Terpsichore More charming somewhat is for me.

It is predicting to my gazing Reward, which I can’t be appraising,

Conditionally by its charms Self-willed desires it alarms.

My friend Elvina! Nothing hinders To love it under table cloth,

In spring at grass and so forth, At iron fire-place in winters,

At smooth of parquets in the halls, At sea on granite and at malls.

XXXIII

I keep in mind the sea, quite stormy: What envious I was when waves

In turn to girl were all returning With love to feet to lay themselves.

With waves I wished myself somehow To touch her dear feet by mouth.

Among all those ardent days Of boiling youth, such bright and gay,

I never wished with such a torture To kiss young Armid’s pretty lips,

Or roses of flaming cheeks, Or bosom, which awaits for fortune.

Ah, never impulse of the sense Put rack my soul ever hence.

XXXIV

But other times in mind I bear!

I saw myself in cherished dream

To keep the happy stirrup dare...

Meanwhile small foot in hands l feel;

And works again imagination. Again her touch of fascination

In cold heart is kindling blood... Again the grief, of love the flood!

The talkative my lyre’s tired To glorify all haughty ranks.

They don’t cost yet neither sense, Nor any songs, by them inspired:

Of sorceresses words and peep Delusive are... as their feet.

XXXV

What’s my Onegin?

Way is endless To bed from ballet; half asleep

He speeds through Petersburg, all restless, Awoken by drums’s beat.

The hawkers walk, gets up the salesman, Is dragging to cabstand a cabman,

With jug young woman goes fast, By feet she crushes snow-dust.

The morning pleasant noise arose.

Each shutter’s open, and dry

Blue smoke rises to the sky, And thorough German baker goes

In paper cap for each of us To open his wasistdas.

XXXVI

Of ballet’s noises being tired, Transforming morning into night,

He calmly sleeps in bed, retired From pastimes, flourishing big child.

The afternoon he passes, ready Again to waste his day already.

His life’s monotonous and is mixed, The same for many days is fixed,

But was my Eugene satisfying By being free in prime of life,

Among his victories to thrive, And his amusements gratifying?

May be, in vain he was at feasts Such careless and fine at least?

XXXVII

His passions were too quickly cold, And he was bored by worldly noise;

Not very long he could behold The girls as object of his choice;

Adulteries were not adonng; His friends and freindship made him boring,

As now not at any time He could bear-steaks and Strassburg pie

With fizz by bottle wine be pouring While saying clever pncky word -

Because of ache of own head. And, though staying rake adoring,

He ceased to like (with them was led) Invectives, sables and the lead.

XXXVIII

His illness never was distinguished From illness, known so far,

Which they are calling spleen in English, In Russian known as khandra.

It caught him now and for ever; But yet to kill himself he never,

Thanks God, had any wish to try; But at the life his look was wry.

Child-Harold’s copy, grim, morose To inner rooms and halls he came;

The boston, gossips were in vain, Or dear looks or sighs - all those

Did never touch hire as before, He caught the sight of nothing more.

XXXIX, XL, XLI ………………….. 	………………….. 	…………………..

XLII

Of higher world the queer ladies!

The first he made - he left you all;

It’s true, that all we live in ages, When rather boring is high call.

Arid though ladies can be talking Of Say and Bentham at the walking,

But as a whole their talk Is harmless, but unpleasant mock.

Besides, they all are so pure, Magestic, for the love unfit,

Are full of piety, of wit, Such cautious, that we can’t endure,

And always turned, from us - I mean. That their looks give rise for spleen.

XLIII

And you, the girls all young, good looking, Whom droshkies quickly take away

In late of evening, such amusing, Along the Petersburg high-way,

By him were left at your employments.

Apostate of wild enjoyments,

At home did he shut himself And yawning, tried to write of self.

He tried, but of the work persistent He felt yet sickness. Nothing good

Could come of such a lazy mood. He didn’t join the guild existent

Of men, whom I can’t judge for long, As I myself to them belong.

XLIV

Devoted to lazy feeling, With void in soul, he resstrains

His temper, in his chair sitting, And aims to own each other’s brains;

With ranks of books his shelf fulfilling, For long he eagerly was reading,

But saw: annui, the rave, the harm, The fraud; nor shame, nor sense, nor charm;

In all of them restriction’s queer; Antiquity the old backs.

The novelty with ages smacks.

Like women, books were all left here,

And shelf with dusty books anew With mourning taffeta he drew.

XLV

Of world conventions breaking load Like he I lagged behind of fuss,

I was his friend some while ago.

I liked his features in the past:

Devotion to dreams unwitting, Unimitated strange unfitting,

His sharp, but somewhat cooling wit.

I was embittered, he… unfit.

We knew the game of passion’s oath; By life were anguished as a rule;

The heat of hearts became all cool; Besides we were awaited both

By spite of fortune and of mean, While both were beginners then.

XLVI

Who has ideas and is living, He looks at people with disdain,

He has a trouble from the feeling Of spook of unreturning day.

He hasn’t any fascinations, But has some snake of recollections,

And him repentance badly nags; This inspiration often adds

Great charm to any conversation.

At first his language me confused,

But in a while I had been used To caustic, hot argumentation,

To jokes mixtured with the bile, To epigrams with no smile.

XLVI1

And often in the summer’s sphere, When clear is the sky at night

All over the Neva river, When waters, being gaily light,

Do not reflect Diana’s features, Recalling bygone novel’s creatures,

Recalling former love, such free, Perceptible and carefree,

By night’s benevolent light breathing We mutely reveled and could fail!

Like convict in the stocks from jail If brought to forests while he’s sleeping,

We all were taken by the dreams, As if young life anew begins.

XLVIII

With utterly regretful soul, On granit leaning, straight. upright,

Stood Eugene, thoughtful, quite alone, As poet himself described.

Night sentries, far from one to other, In stillness called each one another;

Of droshky light, remote noise From Million street was heard.

Some boys In boat with its oars rowed Along the sleepy Neva’s stream,

And we adored, like in a dream, Some song of horn and man, such bold...

More sweet, than joys beneath the moon, Will stay of Torkwat’s octaves tune!

XLIX

Oh, Brenta! I again shall see you. My dear Adriatic waves,

Inspired, I again shall feel you, Your magic voice for me awaits!

Appolo’s children took it sacred; For Albion proud lyre rated

I love him, he’s my kin in-law.

Italian nights I shall adore.

And being free, again	revel In girl from Venece, pretty, young,

Sometimes she’s talkative or dumb, In secret gondola I’ll travel

With her, my lips will find anew Petrarka’s language ‘I love you’ .

L

But will it come, my day of freedom?

Its time! - I everyday appeal.

At sea I wait for better season, The sails of ships I call, I feel,

That under gale, en waves in boat All over the sea crossroad

Should I begin my freedom flight.

It’s time to leave for life the tight

And hostile shore, I shall be rushing To come to midday desert steppe

In Africa; at any step To sigh about mirky Russia,

In which 1 loved and suffered hard, And where buried I my heart.

LI

Onegin was already ready With me some foreign lands to rate,

But fate for us was never steady: For long we had to separate.

Away had passed his old father, Onegin was attacked by rather

Aggressive lenders each offends, Each has his own wit and sense.

But Eugene all the lawsuits hated With lot contented, gave all them

Inheritage, he had by then, Not seeing loss in all, he wasted

Or may be guessed from far away That uncle his would pass away.

LII

Report for him was so sudden From steward:

“Uncle is in bed, His breath again began to harden, To see his nephew he’d be glad”.

In sadness he it all was reading, At once he hurried for the meeting,

By post-chase he headlong went, Was yawning sweetly before hand,

Prepared for the sake of money To sighs, to boredom and to fraud

(With all that I began my thought). But when he reached it in a hurry,

On table Eugene found then For funeral prepared man.

LIII

He found house full of servants; To see deceased, from any sides

His friends arrived like vile observers Who come to funerals all times.

Deceased was buried after meeting, The priests and guests were drinking, eating,

Then all they grandly went away, As if they spent a business day.

The former foe of the orders, The waster, Eugene of the lands,

Of waters, forests and of hands Is master in the country borders;

He’s very glad that former pass He changed for anything at last.

LIV

At first two days anew he drove Along secluded lone fields

In coolness of the gloomy grove With purl and babble of still streams,

On third day, looking all around, He saw nor copse, nor hill, nor ground;

He quickly sleepy was from them, And grasped all clearly by then:

In country tedium’s prevailing Without palaces or streets,

Nor ballets, cards, nor verse one meets.

Khandra pursued him, always waiting,

It looked for him through all his life Like own shade or loyal wife.

LV

But I was born for peaceful living, In village stillness gladly breathe,

In country lyre is more ringing, More vivid are creative dreams.

Devoted to childish leisure 1 hike at lake in desert nature,

And far niente is my law.	 I wake at mornings to adore

The sweet prosperity and freedom; I read a little, sleep for long,

For flying glory don’t long.

The same I was in time of wisdom,

All days I spent in sleep, in shades, And there had my happiest days.

LVI

The love, the plants, the void, the village, The fields! to you I’m staunch a friend.

From Eugene differ I my image, To note this I always trend,

In order that derisive reader, Or any editor, too eager

For intricate and slander talk, In checking all my traits for mock,

Could not repeat, yet being shameless, That I could scribble own face

Like Byron, poet of grace. Or it’s impossible or faithless

To write about otherself As if about ownself?

LVII

All poets, meanwhile I’ll note, Of dreamy, pensive love are friends,

Sometimes in dream they all, whom dote, To soul mine arrived like guests:

My soul secret forms was keeping, My muse made all them once more living,

And I, untroubled, glorified The girl from rocks, ideal my,

And girls, at banks Salgirian captured.

But now, friends, from all my sides -

‘Of whom your own lyre sighs?’ By you I’m often briskly questioned, -

‘To whom in throng of jealous girls You dedicated tune of hers?’

LVIII

’Whose glance, exciting inspiration, With sweet caress gave best reward

For thoughtful singing with attention?’

‘And whom your lovely verse adored?’

Ah, no one, my friends, believe me!

But road alarm of love then filled me.

All that I gladlessly survived.

He’s blessed, who with his love combined

Of rhymes the fever: he could double Of poetry sacred scraps,

Arid, following Petrarka’s tracks, Could calm his heart’s the biggest trouble.

Could catch the glory by the way: But I in love was dumb, inane.

LIX

The love’s foregone, the muse appeared, And clearer my mind became,

I’m free, but look for union, geared In sound, sense and temper game/

I write, and heart yet isn’t boring, The pen unwitting isn’t drawing

Along unfinished rhymes of words No girl’s small feet and no heads.

Extinguished ash will not be heating, Without tears I am sad

And in a while of storm the track In soul mine will soon be ceasing,

And then I shall begin to rhyme New couplets, more than twenty five,

LX

Already I of plan was thinking, Of name of person number one,

From novel’s only beginning — I’ve finished now chapter one.

I checked it all, and very strictly; In many places contradictory,

But never wanted to correct; To censorship I’ll pay my debt;

To journalists I put at mercy Of labour mine some real fruit.

You get along the Neva’s route, Newborn by me the work of fancy;

For me the glory bring, of course: Wry talks, the noise, a lot of curse!

CHAPTER TWO

O , rus!

Hor

O Russia!

I

The hamlet, where Eugene’s boring, Is nice and cosy a nook,

In it a friend of joys quite virgin Could bless the sky if cast a look.

His house stood in place selected, From winds by mountains protected,

On river’s batik; and far away In front of it, all looking gay,

Some meadows and fields extended; Somewhere villages were seen,

Some herds were walking in the scene, By garden canopies were ended,

It was neglected., large in gauge, Of dryads shelter for an age.

II

The honoured castle was erected Like all such castles: it was fine

And placid, solidly effected, In style of clever old time.

At any place there are some chambers, Of damask are in rooms wallpapers,

The portraits of the tsars on walls, And motley tiles on stoves.

All’s By now much dilapidated, Indeed, I don’t know why.

But anyway the friend of mine To be light-hearted had been fated,

As he indifferently could yawn Inside antique or modern hall.

III

Onegin had that room for living, In which his uncle lived on earth:

At window he flies was killing And daily house-keeper cursed.

It all was simple: floors of oak, Divan, the table, large wardrobe,

Of any ink not any spot, In room two cupboards they had got:

In one he saw of brandies order, In other found debit book,

A jug for apple juice he took, An old calendar in order:

The old man had no time To read the books of other kind.

IV

Among his properties alone, To pass away his lazy time,

He wanted to establish own, In orders newer fashioned line:

In country’s place the man of wisdom, He gave his serfs a piece of freedom:

The corvee yoke changed for rate, And serfs were blessing their fate.

For that a neighbour in his farming Was puffing up: to his big farm

He saw in it some dreadful harm; The other smiled, but smile was cunning;

And they expressed the common wish To call him dangerous queer fish.

V

At first they came to him for visit But as he usually was gone

(For him to hide was very easy By riding stallion from the Don,

When suddenly from village rear He could some droshky’s sounds hear),

Such acts insulted neighbours all, They stopped to come to him at all.

’He’s ignoramus’, said the neighbours, ’He is free-thinker, drinks red wine

From glass not stopping For a while’. He never kisses hands of ladies,

Says yes or no, never да-с Or нет-с’(the words, they all would pass).

VI

In own village to appear New landlord in a droshky came,

And to the same and strict revealer, To neighbourhood occasions gave.

By name he was Vladimir Lensky. With Göttingen in soul frankly,

He, dandy in his prime, approves All Kant’s ideas and his moves.

He brought from Germany his dear, As poet, of learning fruits,

Were full of liberty his views And soul. Ardent, somewhat queer

Was his emotional speech. Black curls his shoulders could reach.

VII

From cold world of dissipation To fade away not having time,

His soul’s warmed with inspiration By lady’s greetings, friendly kind.

Concerns of heart he was ignoring, He future hopes was adoring,

And of the world new lustre, noise Fulfilled his wit with future joys.

By honeyed dream he was amusing The doubts of his own heart;

For him the aim of life was smart Quite puzzling riddle, much alluring,

He puzzled over effect, In it could miracles suspect.

VIII

He did believe, that soul dear Will join enevitably him,

That she, delightless in the near, Is daily waiting just for him;

And he was sure: friends are ready To suffer all for him already,

Will never tremble their hand To beat the slander off a man;

That there are by fate selected Of people dear sacred friends;

That their friendship never ends; By unreflected rays effected,

It will sometime all us illume, Will gift the world some blessed perfume.

IX

Regret, resentment, being sorry, Some pure love to every boon,

Some sweetish torture of the glory His blood excited very soon.

With lyre, while abroad residing, In Goethe’s, Shiner’s places hiking,

By their poetic light He own soul did ignite.

Of art high muses fine impressions He, happy, never put to shame,

In songs could proudly retain For all his life exalted passions

And impulses of virgin dream, And grand simplicity in him.

X

He sang of love, for love was loyal, His song was clear like the noon,

Like thoughts of simple lady’s soul, Like dreams of child, or like the moon

In deserts of the heaven’s districts, The goddess of the sighs and secrets.

He sang of partings and of griefs, Of something, foggy misbeliefs,

And of romantic finest rose. He sang of countries: far away

In them in stillness of the day He real tears could expose;

He sang of how life could fade; All that in his teenage he made.

XI

The one was Eugene in these deserts, Who could evaluate his gifts.

But landlords of the country’s peasants Were never liked by him at feasts;

The noisy talks he was escaping; All their prudent talk, such raving,

About haying and of wine, Of kennels, of relation’s lint, -

Could never show shining passion, Nor sparks of poetic light,

Nor sharpness, nor some sign of mind, Nor of communal life succession;

But talk of their dear wives By absent wit him always strikes.

XII

He’s handsome, rich, of fair manner. And neighbours said: he needs a bride.

Such custom’s known everywhere: To marry daughters every tried

To have half-Russian neighbour dear; As quickly as he can appear

They speak to him of no more, But being bachelor is bore;

Him call to sit to samovar, And Doonya quickly gives him tea,

They whisper her, You, Doonya, see!

Then bring to Doonya some guitar,

And she is squeaking (dear me!): In gold chamber visit me!...

XIII

But Lensky, having no wishes Of marriage ties the weight to have,

To Eugene sent his hearty greetings: Some hints on nearness he gave.

They friends became.

But wave and stone, The ice and flame, the verse and prose

Have less in difference between Each one.

At first they’d nothing seen In common.

Then they estimated Each one another; daily forth

They met each other, riding horse, And then became unseparated.

Such men (I’m first of them to blame) From boredom dear friends became,

XIV

But even such a friendship, readers, We haven’t now; each of us

Without prejudice considers The others oils but us as ones.

To be Napoleon each wishes, But millions of the two-legged creatures

For us are only some tools, And all ones passionate are fools.

But Eugene was beyond conception: Of course, he knew the people well,

In general he gave them hell, But any rule has some exception:

He differed people in effect, And other’s passions could respect.

XV

To Lensky he could listen smiling.

His ardent talk was full of haze;

His wit of poet was milding; His constantly inspired faze, -

He tried his cooling word to own, To keep away from man like this;

He thought: a fool would trouble his Such quickly fading high affection,

Without me his time will come, But now let him live in calm

And great belief in world’s perfection, Forgive him ardour of his age,

Of young delirium high rage.

XVI

Each topic’s argued at the meetings: To meditate they were in mood

On real price of ancient treaties, On evil, good, on science fruit,

On old prejudices harmful, Eternal secret tombs alarmful,

The fate and life in their turn To their judgement could return.

The poet in heat of judgement Some nothern poem could cite,

As if to prove that he was right. And Eugene, passionate, indulgent,

Who understood it wee a hit, All his attention paid to it.

XVII

But often passions were invading The mind of hermits, of my men.

Of passions press at last escaping, Again Onegin said of them

Unwillingly, with sighs of pity: He’s blessed, who knew all their pretty

Effects, but stepped away anew; He’s blessed much more, who never knew

The love; who cooled it with divorcement, By scandal enmity could strand,

And yawned with happy wife and friend, Not troubled by the jealous torment;

Who father’s money never trusts To cunning friends, to crufty cards,

XVIII

When we shall gather under banner Of stillness, rational and cairn,

When well have cooled the passions temper And no more they would alarm

All us, well laugh at their impulse, At late ridiculous opinions,

Then we’ll submissively obey To hear stories by the way

About other’s restless passions, And other’s love will touch the heart, -

We’ll be like invalid in hut, Who nears ears to confessions

Of boasting moustached young guards Who conquered pretty ladies’ hearts.

XIX

But all the youngsters, always flaming, Could never enmity conceal,

The sadness, gladness, love inflaming They all were ready to reveal.

Onegin no love could hook in, But listened with a pompous look-in

To Lensky speaking of himself, Revealing all his heart itself,

His conscience Lensky was revealing, His own soul criticized.

Onegin quickly recognized The talk of love, which was fulfilling

With many senses all this fuss, Which is antique for all of us.

XX

Ah, he could love; they don’t now Have anything like real love

Of poet, who’s anyhow Convicted to the truthful love:

One vision always, everywhere, The rime desire comes to dare

To comfort sorrow and grief.

And nothing cooled his strong belief:

Nor longest years of the partings, Nor all to muses given time,

Nor foreign beauties so fine, Nor sciences, nor evening parties

Could change his soul little bit: Some virgin fire flamed in it,

XXI

Yet child, by Olga fascinated, Ignorant yet of hearty pains,

He, touching witness, captivated By childish prettiness of games

In shade of old trees protective, He was in games her mate effective.

And parents foresaw the fate: Were calculating wedding date;

In stillness of the humble grove Of innocence some charming loom,

She near parents could bloom, Like lilies in the valley grow,

Unknown in the thick of grass To bees, to moths at no paths.

XXII

To her was due first dream unquiet Of poet: at love the drive,

And thought of her in him inspired First moan of his conscious life.

But you forgive him, games in stillness!

He liked the grove’s timid thickness,

He liked the stillness, lone mood, The night, the stars, the round moon.

The moon, this miracle in heavens, To which we dedicated nights

At meetings but without lights, And tears, secret torment’s gladness...

But now dear moon for us Is mere lantern in the skies.

XXIII

She’s dutiful and always modest, As fresh as morning, always gay,

Like life of bard, such simple, honest, Like kiss of love at dawn of day;

The eyes are blue as depth of heavens, The smile, the flaxen curls of hairs,

The movings, voice, the figure fine, All Olga has... but you can find

At any novel those features, Her own portrait, very nice;

I was in love with it sometimes, But soon was bored by pretty creatures.

Allow me, the readers mine, To show you her elder line.

XXIV

Tatyana was the name of sister... Such name we use to gratify

The novel’s pages of my either, At will that name well sanctify.

Why not? It’s pleasant and sonorous; With it, I know, always goes

Reminiscence of old time, Of maiden’s room!

We must meanwhile

Confess; we have the taste quite mere In life, as well as in the names,

(Not speaking of the verses frames). The education can’t adhere

To us: from it we have not more Than mincing manners to adore.

XXV

But well, she’s named Tatyana; gladless, Nor by her sister’s pretty grace,

Nor by her pleasant ruddy freshness She’d catch one’s eyes by simple face.

She’s wild and sad, is daily silent. Like forest calf, she’s often frightened,

In own family she was Like strange a girl in thoughts quite lost;

She never could caress inspire For parents; it all seemed wrong.

Yet being child, in children’s throng To play and jump had none desire,

But at the window, not gay, Was mutely sitting all the day.

XXVI

To pensiveness she got accustomed From cradle to the present day,

And drifting of the country’s pastime In all her dreams looked better, gay.

Her tender fingers didn’t dare To take a needle; she could never

Some frame and lace for working fit, In silk embroider never did.

As sign of lust for future being The master of her home, child

In games with doll can train for mild Decorum of the loyal living:

Importantly repeats for doll The mother’s lessons, though small.

XXVII

Yet being child, at any year Tatyana didn’t play with doll;

About news and fashions dear With dolls she didn’t talk at all,

For all the childish tricks felt sorry, To them was stranger; dreadful story

In winter darkness of the night Was captivating heart and mind.

But when the nurse in summer gathered To Olga all her little friends,

Tatyana hadn’t any trends To play with them in any weather:

She’s always bored by loud laughs By noise of their playful muffs.

XXVIII

On balcony at morning sitting She liked to meet the break of day,

When clouds in the sky are drifting And stars in turn all get away,

And calmly edge of earth is lighting, And, sign of day, the wind is rising,

And gradually rises day.

In winter, when the night’s weak shade

Possesses half of world existing Much longer, in the softened loom

Of pale and foggy, sleepy moon The lazy East is yet asleeping, -

At usual hour stirred up, In candle’s light she’s getting up.

XXIX

The novels were for many years Her inner life, were liked by her;

She loved the fraud about fears Of Richardson and by Rousseau.

Her father was good-humoured being, From age retarted. Scornful feeling

He had of books, as no harm In them he saw, but no charm

Could grasp in idle, futile reading, Was not concerned a little bit

Of what the secret book, she hid, In daughter’s bed till day was dreaming

His wife herself such feeling had: From Richardson to be quite mad.

XXX

She liked the books of Richardson Yet no because them all she read.

And not because the Grandison To Lovelace was by her prefered;

It was because of cousin dear: In Moscow princess Alina

Was talking much of them with pride.

For husband then she was yet bride.

But, being wife, she willy-nilly Yet sighed for man of other kind,

Who pleased her soul and the mind, Much more was touching all her feeling:

Good guy and sergeant of the guards, This Grandison could play the cards.

XXXI

Like he, she was well-dressed, in fashion, In best attires every day;

But soon, not asked for her concession, Was to the altar led away.

To dissipate her greatest woe	 Judicious husband had a go:

To village own took her soon; But she was often in a fume,

Some days was crying, then was trying To get divorce from newly man;

But soon to farming she began To be accustomed and relying.

By us the habits have been got Instead of happiness from God.

XXXII

The habits sugared all her woe Which wasn’t smoothed by any chance:

But soon she all was full of go, By it she calmed herself at once:

Between affairs and the leisure She found out with a pleasure

The way to keep her man away! And everything became o’key.

She was the works in fields observing, She salted mushrooms, punished men,

She kept accounts; always then On Saturdays they bath were serving,

Sometimes she beat a house-maid, - All that not asking man she made.

XXXIII

Sometimes with own blood she wrote To lady’s album if by chance,

Then changed in strict and quick a mode The maiden’s names by names from France,

She tried her corset tight to wear, And Russian “н” in French best manner

Through nose singingly could say, But soon her mood could pass away:

To her it all seemed rather queer, She all forgot, replaced again

Each name from France by Russian name, Forgot princess Alina dear;

And she herself renewed at last Night-cap and dressing-gown fast.

XXXIV

Her husband’s love to wife was hearty, Her deeds he took for mere crank,

To trust his wife he was light-hearted, In dressing-gown ate and drank.

His life was calm, without woe. Sometimes his neighbours in his home

Would come together at week-ends, Unceremonious dear friends,

To grieve, to talk of new affairs, To laugh, to gossip for a while,

And thus the time would pass; meanwhile They ask, and Olga tea prepares;

Then supper... time to be in bed, And soon the guests all home get.

XXXV

They kept in peaceful life some customs Of dear old days; it means:

They were at Shrove-day accustomed To have the fattest Russian blins;

They had a fasting twice a year, They liked of round swing high gear,

The guessing songs and round dance, On all Whitsundays caught a chance,

While people yawn in church at prayer, To find a bunch of praying grass

And drop some tears twice or thrice; They needed kvass not less than air,

At table each of dear guests Had course according to the ranks.

XXXVI

And so grew they old both.

But soon for husband, all at once,

The door of coffin was unclosed: To have new wreath he got a chance;

He died at hour of dinner, Bermoned by his neighbours dear,

By children and by loyal wife With candid never seen in life.

He was a common Russian barin, Was kind and good; at his remains

The monument in words explains Submissive sinner, Dimitry Larin,

The brigadier, a slave of God, Has peace by him forever got.

XXXVII

At his Penates, quite permissive Vladimir honoured all, who died;

At neighbour’s monument submissive He dedicated him a sigh;

His heart was sad, his voice was mournful.

‘Ah, poor Yorick, said he, joyful

He kept me often in his hands, While I could show many pranks

With medal for Ochakov playing, Intended Olga for my wife

And wondered: would he be alive?’

Sincerely, in grief embracing

His heart, Vladimir qickly penned At tomb a madrigal by hand.

XXXVIII

By writing verse, the dismal mourner Of parents, with running eyes,

The ashes patriarchal honoured.

Alas! On furrows of lives

New generations by some reason, At secret will of great provision

Arise and ripen, then will fall, And others after them come all,

To-day frivolous generation Matures, stirs, already tests

Grandfathers to the tombs do press, It comes, the time of exitation,

Grandchildren once upon good day Will press from world all us away.

XXXIX

Meanwhile in life you try to revel, As much as I you take form it!

I grasp its vanity, and never Too much I was attached to it;

For fantoms I my eyelids closed; But some remote dear hopes

Sometimes are troubling wit and heart: Without printing pretty mark

To leave the world I would he sorry.

I live and write not for applause,

But, seems to me I’d wish, of course To fill my fate with kind of glory.

In hope that by future friend Of me some sound will be said.

XL

The heart of somebody he’ll cherish, Arid, kept by touch of truthful fate,

Perhaps, in Lethe won’t perish My verse, by wit and heart well made;

Perhaps, in front of portrait famous, To people future ignoramous

Will show my renowned face And say: ‘It’s poet of grace!’

Accept you all my thankful feelings Admirer of peaceful muse,

Ah, you, whose memory will fuse In verse my flying feeble dealings,

Whose grateful, feeling, truthful hand Will pat the fame of old man!

CHAPTER THREE

Fille était fille, elle était amourese. She was a girl She was in love.

Malfilatre.

I

‘What way?

You poets, are queer!’ -Good bye, Onegin, time has gone.

‘I don’t hamper you, but dear, For evenings where have you gone?

-To Larin’s -’Oh, looks it strangely: To kill your pretty evenings daily…

Forgive me, isn’t it too hard?’ -For me it’s not - ‘But dear bard,

I don’t grasp despite endeavours; You listen to (if I am right?)

This Russian family seems light, To all the guests it’s always zealous,

The jams, eternal talk of all: Of rain, of flax, of horses’ stall…’

II

-In this I see yet no troubles…

‘But trouble is: they are such bores’.

-I hate your world of fashion marbles, Much more I like the world indoors,

And there… -

‘For the sake of goodness, You keep the eclog, now useless.

I’m sorry that you go… well, My dear Lensky, will you tell,

If that Fillidae you can show, The subject for the pen to mourn,

For tears, rhymes and so on?… Present me her’.

- D’you joke -

‘No’.

-I’m glad. - ‘but when?’ -Well, now just, They will receive with pleasure us.

III

-Let’s go.- They were quietly driven,

And got to neighbours in a while. At once they heartily were given

All services of old time.

It was well known friendly wellcome:

On saucers jam they gave, and seldom Some berry water in a jug Put on a table, and a cup.

IV

The way is short, from dear neighbour They go home fast, at speed;

Let’s listen, yet without labour, To their talking, short indeed.

But why, Onegin, you are yawning? -

‘My habit,..

I…’ -But you are boring

Much more... -

‘Well, no, just the same...

The field is dark in pretty gale...

Andryushka, quicker must you go!

What foolish, dumpy is this place!

You see, your Larina is plain, But very dear old soul;

And I’m afraid: in spite of charm That water brings me much of harm...

V

You tell, of them which is Tatyana?’ -That girl, which’s always so sad;

She’s taciturn like that Swetlana,.. When came, at window she sat.-

‘But do you love, indeed, the other?’ -And what? -

‘But I’d prefer another,

If I were poet like you.

Of life her features have but few.

Like in van Dick’s Madonna finness, Her face is round, red, she’s boon

As well as ruddy foolish moon At the horizon’s foolish brightness’.

Vladimir answered short, was dry. Then he was mute, his face was wry.

VI

Meanwhile Onegin’s stay at Larin’s Was estimated like a news,

Affected native Russian banns, And all the neighbours were amused.

They all began to guess of reasons, Invented stealthily decisions,

They joked, not without sin At Tanya’s suitor made a hint.

Some neighbours said of the impression That wedding had some pointed time,

But was delayed for short a while As they had no rings of fashion.

About Lensky’s wedding all Were sure neighbours once for all.

VII

Tatyana heard with indignation All those gossips, but she had

With unexpected consolation Unwittingly some thought of that:

Some string of love in her appeared, In love affairs she was geared

As well as seeds in vital strife In earth by spring are given life.

Long since the girl began to languish, Could burn in bliss, in dismal mood,

Her spirit longed for fatal food; Long since unbearable anguish

Made all young heart to pine away, For someone did her soul wait.

VIII

She waited, looked and anyhow She said: well, yes! it must be He

Alas! all days and nights are now One long and lone dream in heat,

All’s filled by Him, by image dear, And magic force, that she can hear,

Yet speaks of Him; and she avoids The sounds of the tender voice

And gaze attentive of her maidens; She daily greatly is depressed;

She doesn’t listen to the guests And curses their idle leisures,

Unwaited coming any day And each delay to get away.

IX

And -now she with great attention Voluptuous novels quickly reads,

With what a lively fascination Deludes herself with all deceits!

By happy force of own dreamings She brings to life all novel’s beings,

Like Julie’s lovers, grand Wollmar, Malek-Adel and De Linar,

And Vertcr, that rebellious martyr, Unimitable Grandison

With whom we all to sleep had gone; - For tender girl, the dreamer hearty,

In single image they confused, In one Onegin all were fused.

X

She feels herself like all her dear Of books beloved main persons feel:

Clarissa, Julie and Delphina; Tatyana in the forest’s still

With dangerous book alone’s hiking, In it reveals she so striking

Her secret heat, of which she dreamt, Whose plenitude ih heart she felt.

She sighs, assuming as her real Delights of others and the griefs;

Each day she whispers own myths Of letter to her image dear.

But hero, I’m not wrong, Could never be like Grandison.

XI

His style to pompous tune rerversing An ardent author tried sometimes

To show his beloved main person As perfect one for all the times,

And gave this person all the beauty, And made him wrongly persecuted;

With tender soul, clear sense Him gave attractive handsome face,

And heated by the pure passion This agitated person bade

His wish to sacrifice his fate; But for the end (to make impression)

Was always punished wicked vice, And good was given garlands twice.

XII

In haze are now minds of people: The moral them to sleep just makes;

The vice, that’s gentle but not feeble, In novels now celebrates.

Of British muse some old fables Her dreams disturb, and it enables

As idols now to have got Or Vampire, who’s lost in thought,

Or vagrant Melmoth, such distressful, Or Corsair, or Eternal Jew,

Or Sbogar, mythical a few.

Lord Byron with his whim successful Enveloped fussy egoism In hopeless romanticism.

XIII

But dear friends, it all is useless: If I in future won’t be

A poet by will of goodness, New devil then will enter me;

In spite of Foebus warning notes Myself I’ll humble to the prose, When novels in the old ways

Will take the twilight of my days.

Not secret tortures of the evil Would I in prose represent,

But simply I to you will send The legends of the Russian real

Past clans; the charming dreams of love, Antique moralities beloved.

XIV

In them I’ll write of simple speeches Of dad, of uncle, old man:

Of bold children’s secret meetings That near lime at brook began.

Of partings, jealous indignation, Of tears of conciliation;

Again of scandals, and at last To altar I shall lead them fast,

And I’ll remind the speech of passion, The words of longing, wistful love

That on the days I meant above, At feet of ladies fox expression

Of feelings quickly came to mind, But now weakly lag behind.

XV

Tatyana, ah, Tatyana dear!

With you I now tears shed;

Of tyrant you didn’t fear, But now he your fate has had.

You’ll perish, but before you go, You try in dazzling pretty hope

Some darkling blessing to invite To know better bliss of life

And magic poison of its itches; You are pursued by happy dream,

At any place you fancy him, The refuge for the happy wishes;

At any place in front of you Your fatal tempter waits for you.

XVI

In grief of love Tatyana goes To their garden, she is sad;

But suddenly her eyelids close, She hasitates to make a step..,

Her chest is high, her cheeks are covered By instant flame, they quickly flowered,

The breath is fading in her lips, She heard some noise, her eyes did glimpse...

The night then comes, the moon is mooving Around distant parts of sky;

A nightingale in haze of night His loud melodies is tuning.

In dark my Tanya’s quite upset With nurse in whisper has a chat:

XVII

‘...can’t sleep, it’s stuffy, you unclose The window and sit beside...’

-But what is it -

‘You tell of those Your old times... I’ve boring tide..’

-But what about?

I had happened To know many old legends,

A lot of stories with the whirls, With wicked ghosts and the girls...

My memory is dark.., I’m granny... And much forgot... of life the line

Is drawn, in turn I’ve bad nay time.

My poor mind...

- You tell me, nanny,

About girls, you meant above, And how did you fall in love?

XVIII

-Ah, dear my! in my teenager We heard yet nothing of the love,

Or otherwise I’d be with rages By all my kin pursued for love.-

‘But how did you marry, nanny?’ -It was by wish of God.

My Vanny Was younger, than myself I mean, And I was, dear, yet thirteen.

For weeks matchmaker was then coming To all my kin, and due to that

My father gave consent to wed.

In fear I was crying, darling,

In weep my plait was then undid, With songs to altar us could lead.

XIX

And I’m in family unknown...

But are you listening yet to me?

‘Well... I, my nanny… don’t know... For love I’m longing, dear me!

To cry, to weep I’m now ready...’ -I see, you are unwell already

My dear God, you bless and save!

What do you want to ask, you say!

But let me help with sacred water.

You are in heat.- - But I’m not ill Well... nanny, I’m in love, I feel.., - God bless you now, dear daughter! -

The nurse was using own way To help the girl with cross and pray.

XX

‘I fell in love’, again she whispers In nurse’s ear in dismay.

-My hearty friend, you have some fevers.-

‘I fell in love... you’d get away

Meanwhile the moon was brightly shining, By languid light it was enlightning

Tatyana’s pale and dismal charms, Her hair down let by chance,

The tracks of tears; in a chair In front of heroine in grief

In wadded jacket and kerchief The old woman with grey hair.

And all around dreams in still, With light of moon its all fulfilled.

XX I

While at the moon Tatyana’s looking, By own heart away she’s gone...

Of mind some vague a thought is moving...

‘You, nanny, let me stay forlone.

You give a pen and paper, dear, I’ll stay in bed; make table near;

Forgive me’.

Lone in the room In stillness, in the light of moon

She’s writing, on the table leaning, And always Eugene’s kept in mind,

Her letter of unwitting kind By love of innocence is breathing.

The letter’s ready, has been fit...

Tatyana, tell: for whom is it?

XXII

I knew some difficult young ladies' Like winter cold, pure, light,

Implacable at their ages, Inscrutable for all my mind;

In them I marvelled at the virtue And fashioned arrogance, that hurts you,

And I confess: from them I fled: It seemed with horror I had read

On their foreheads words of Hades: Forever hopes you must leave...

For them to love yet meant to grieve, To scare males was joy for ages.

May be, you saw at Neva’s banks Some ladies of these queer ranks.

XXIII

Among admirers obedient I’ve seen she-cranks of other kinds:

In pride they were with males indifferent. At distance stayed from praise and sighs.

And I had found then, amazing: By their bashful, stern behaving

They scared love quite timid, shy., But they attracted lovers by

At least regret, sincere pity, At least by sounds of the speech,

Which seemed to be more tender, rich; And with the trustful blind entreaty

Some youthful lover ran again Behind the fuss, but all in vain.

XXIV

But why Talyana should be guilty?

Because she’s innocent and plain,

Of fraud she knows nothing strictly And wants to dream her life away?

Because her love is not of fashion, Obedient to the call of passion?

Because ire, truthfulness she’s swift? Because from heavens got as gift

To have some quick and restless fancy? Because her will and wit has had

And wayward, willful is her head? Or heart is flaming, tender, healthy?

But can’t you really absolve Her passions, if you them revolve?

XXV

Coquette is judging always coolly; Tatyana loves without jest,

For love she’s dedicated truly Like loyal child for mother’s nest,

She doesn’t say: ‘Let us postpone For multiplying price of own

Attractiveness; to catch in nets By first expressing some regret

For hopes; then misunderstanding Well use to break the heart; again

Return him life by jealous flame Or otherwise the male offended,

Like prisoner from any chain Is ready to escape again,

XXVI

But l forsee some more of bounds: The honour of my land to save,

I have without any doubts Tatyana’s letter to translate.

Uneasily she was expressing Her thoughts in mother tongue expressive;

Her Russian was yet very bad As Russian books she never read.

That’s why in French she’s always writing.

Alas! I must repeat again:

A lady’s love until to-day To speak her Russian isn’t trying,

And proud language’s now lit For prose postal a bit.

XXYII

To-day they wish to make each lady To read in Russian.

What’s the end?

You’ll hardly meet to-day a maiden With Russian magazine in hand.

My poets! I’d like to hear If I am right; the ladies dear

To whom in secret you did write Some verse, your sins to justify,

To whom your hearts were dedicating,- In written Russian they were bad

As no knowledge they had had, And dearly were deformating

The grammar; language from abroad For mother tongue they all had got.

XXVIII

And God forbid at evening party Or after ball, at porch, on step

To meet a student while departing, Or scholar wearing night cap.

I don’t like the Russian speeches Without grammar incompleteness, As well as lips without smile.

Perhaps I’ll grieve if in a while

Of younger beauties generation Will follow the journal’s call:

To grammar will subdue us all, To verse will pay too much attention:

But I… it doesn’t bother me: To old times I’ll loyal be.

XXIX

Some wrong and wry neglectful babble Of mispronouncing of words

Like long before make heart my tremble And all my soul always flirts.

To have remorse I haven’t forces; Like Bogdanovich’s all verses I’d like all dear gallicisrns, As well as previous youthful sins.

But well, its time I should be busy: The beauty’s letter I should use.

But I am ready to refuse As its translation isn’t easy.

I know: Parny’s tender rhymes Make no hit at present times.

XXX

The bard of feasts, of languid sadness, you had chance to stay with me,

With my request immodest, gladless I’d trouble you for helping me:

To make your dear magic tuning Of beauty’s passion mood, resuming

Some foreign words, she often writes.

But where are you? Come! My rights

To you	give with my endeavours And bows.

But in gloomy cliffs

Instead of praise he gets yet griefs: Alone under Finnish heavens

He’s hiking. Never, I believe, He has been bothered that I grieve.

XXXI

In hands I have Tatyana’s letter. It’s kept by me with sacred sigh.

With secret grief I read this matter, While reading cannot put aside.

By whom was tenderness inspired? - With words neglectness who’s admired?

And who inspired touching talk Which looks like madman’s hearty mock.

It’s both harmful and absorbing.

All that I don’t grasp.

Let’s read

My bad translation incomplete. Its like of picture poor copy; Or like of

«Freischutz» lovely tune But played by pupils in a Fume.

Tatyana’s letter to Onegin.

I write to you - what more or other To add to all by this is said?

And now at your will is rather To punish me with scorn for that.

But if my wretched fate you rather Will grasp with pity little bit, You’ll never leave me such unfit.

At first I wished to keep it secret; Believe me: never of my shame You’d guess, as I would well behave

If I had any hope rigid Not often, mere once a week,

At you in village have a weak But look. To listen to your speaking,

A word to say, and then again To think arid think, but of the same All day and night until new meeting.

They say, you are a lone guy, In country’s stillness you are boring.

And we... with nothing can we shine, We all to see you are adoring.

What for you visited all us?

In village, in forgotten stillness Of you I’d never know, thus I wouldn’t know tortures sleepless.

Of agitated soul’s feelings

With time I’d smooth and then might be I’d find a friend to suit my soul, Would be a loyal wife on whole, And virtuous mother I would be.

Some other...

But to no person In all the world I’d give my heart,

It’s all decided (it’s my version) By heavens board: I’m yours at heart.

My life has been a pawn but fruitless Of meeting with my dear friend;

I know, you were sent by goodness, You’ll be my guard until the end,

You came to me when I was sleeping, Unseen you were to me beloved,

Your glance made languish me far love, Your voice was touching all my feeling For long... But that was not a dreamt You came, at once I got to know: Inflamed and heated I was whole.

And then I thought: He’s now in;

It’s true; to you I had boon listening, In stillness spoke. you to me

When I to wretchers was assisting Or by the prayer was releasing From stress my soul within me.

That instant I could trunk with reason

That you had come, my dear vision In darkness came for head of bed

And stilly neared me in calmness. I think its you with love and brightness Could whisper full of hopes word.

What are you: angel guardian trusty Or tempter treacherous and ghastly?

You help my doubts to resolve:

Well, may he all it is by now The fraud of innocent young girl

For changes fated anyhow...

Let it be so: you have had

In hands my fate for ever now, In front of you I tears shed: Defend my soul anyhow...

Imagine: I’m alone, thus From no man have understanding...

It seems to me, my wit is fading And silently I perish must.

I wait: with glance when you approach Some hopes give to poor heart Or heavy dream you stop by hard Alas! deserved by me reproach.

I stop!

I dread to read again...

In fear shameful heart is sinking.

For me your honour is the bail, I trust you bravely all my feeling...

XXXII

Tatyana now sighs and moans, The letter’s trembling on her palm, The wafer’s drying on her own Inflamed by fever rigid tongue.

Her head to shoulder’s inclining, Her light chemise is now sliding From charming shoulder away...

But now radiant moon’s ray Is dying out, and some quaky From earth gets out steam.

A stream Like silver shines. And after dream By hornlet peasants have been waking.

Its morning: everyone again Is up. To her it’s all the same.

XXXIII

She doesn’t see that day is breaking. She sits in bed with hanging head And on her letter isn’t pressing Her well cut out round stamp.

But stealthily the door unlocking Grey-haired nurse already’s walking, With tea on tray is coming up: -My child, it’s time for getting up; But, beauty, you are now ready!

My dear early little bird!

Last evening frightful words I’d heard; Thank God!

I see you strong already!

Of nightly grief I see none track, Your face is blushing poppy-red.-

XXXIV

‘Ah, will you do a favour, nanny?’ -All right, my dear, you command.-

‘D’you think.’ indeed... suspicions any… But do you see...

Ah, don’t mind’ -My friend, by God to hail I dare —

‘You send your grandchild stilly there To give this note to... to my...

The neighbour... order to your guy: Not say a word he must be ready, By no means to call my name!’… -To whom, my dear?

Tell again, You see, I’m now muddle-headed.

Too many neighbours we have had, I cannot count al! them yet.-

XXXV

‘What slow-witted you are, nyanya!’ -I’m old, dear friend of heart, My wit is now fading, Tanya: But long ago I was smart: By word of barin’s will I’d rather…-

‘Ah, nanny, that is quite (mother, I’m never bothered by your wit; I speak of letter, you should fit For that Onegin’ -Well done dealing.

Do not be angry, dear. you Well know: I am dull for you...

But you are pale... What are you feeling? ‘It’s nothing, nanny, not at all.

But send your boy, and first of all’ .

XXXVI

The day had gone, but no answer...

Next day has come...

She’s up at once, Like shade she’s pale, but no answer...

Well dressed, she’s waiting for her chance, But came to Olga her adorer.,.

‘And where is your friend, the former?- Vladimir such request has got, It seems, he us at all forgot.’.

Tatyana’s flushing, all she’s trembling - To be to-day he promised me,- Vladimir answers, - may be, he For post now yet is waiting.- Tatyana stands, she drops her eyes As if reproached by the vice.

XXXVII

It’s getting dark; already, shining, Is hissing evening samovar, It heats the tea-pot, brought from China; Light steam is whirling so far.

By Olga’s hand the tea’s been pouring To little cup of guest adoring By dark and sweetly scenting stream; A boy already brings the cream; At window Tatyana’s standing, She’s breathing at the cooling glass And lost in thought quite deep and vast With pretty finger she is melting On misted window’s cool pane Her pattern O.E. again.

XXXVIII

Meanwhile her soul’s feelings moan, Her tears filled her languid glance...

What chatters!.. Blood in her runs cold...

They rush into the yard at once!

‘Ah, Eugene!’, - She is quickly running, Like shade she’s prompt, to exit’s jumping, From porch for garden through the yard She flies, to look yet back it’s hard; In short a minute she’s been racing Across the bridges and the glade, Along the forest, brook, the lake, She is the lilac bushes breaking, Through flowers she runs... in wrench Without breath she reached a bench,

XXXIX

Has fallen…

‘Here’s He! that’s Eugene!

My God! what thoughts could come to him!’

Of tortures full, her heart refuges The hopes of her heavy dream.

She’s trembling in the heat of fever,	 For him she waits and doesn’t hear That in the garden maidens sing, While they are gathering, not seen, In bushes berries: they were given To sing strict order (while they job To make them banns not to rob As berries never could be eaten: In country they invented then The way the banns to defend!),

Maiden’s Song

Maidens dear, beautiful, We are mates in friendliness,

Let us play inventfully, Lot us play more happily,

Let us sing in gaiety Song of maidens intimate,

Lets attract. brave fellow To the chorus merriful,

When we get that fellow, When we see him, instantly

Let’s away get rapidly, Him bespatter easily

With the berries laughingly, Don’t hear secretly

Maiden’s singing intimate, Don’t peep invisibly

At the games of maidenhood.

XL

But she’s neglectful to the singing, To ringing voices of the maids,

She waits impatiently for feeling That hearty tremble now fades,

That gets away of cheecks the flaming.

Her breast as yet is greatly trembling,

But doesn’t lade the heat of cheeks, And brighter, strickingly it heats,

As well as poor moth is blending And shines like rainbowed a thing

When him a schoolboy clips the wing, Or like a little hare’s trembling

When sees: a hunter from afar At him is looking so far,

XLI

At last she’s very deeply sighing, From little bench is getting

is going, and when she’s trying To turn aside... is coming up

Just He! His gaze on her he’s fixing, Like dreadful shade for her he’s reaching,

And she, as if she’s burned by flame, Has stopped at once and looks away...

But sequels of the sudden meeting To-day, my dear reader-friend,

I cannot show to the end As I must go after speaking

To have a rest and have a hike, That’s why I’ll finish other time.

CHAPTER FOUR

La morale est dans 					la natura des choses.

Necker 					The morality is 					In the nature of things.

I, II, III, IV, V, VI, VII

The less we love a pretty woman, The easier she’s liking us,

The surely we may her min Among the nets of tempting fuss.

The cool debauchery was known As science of the love: its own

Delights it glorifies itself, Without love it revels self.

But such amusements, yet important, Are worthy of an old ape

Of praised grandfather’s old age: The Lovelace fame is now rottened

With all the fame of red high heels, With grand, magestic old wigs.

VIII

Who isn’t bored to be dissembling, To tell the same who never ends?

Who grandly tries but mere rambling To prove the people: eggs is eggs?

Who listens to the same objections And bans the thoughts of wrong reflections

Of girls, which never had that sin As they are only thirteen?

Whom don’t bore the falseful fears, The prayers, swears, threats and hints,

Love-letter secrets on six sheets, The fraud, the gossip, rings, the tears,

Of many kin suspicious gaze, Of husbands friendship’s heavy haze?

IX

That was the way of Eugene’s thinking.

In his first youth he was untrained,

Was victim of the wild misleading Of big his passions unrestrained.

By habits of the life he’s pampered, By somebody he was well tempered,

But others made him disappoint! The slow languid was the point.

He’s languished by the hits rebuffing, Attentive in the still and noise

To protests of soul’s voice, Suppressed his yawning by his laughing.

Eight years did he kill these ways, And thus he lost of prime young days.

X

He ceased to fall in love with beauties And dangled after like the rest;

Himself consoled if not suited, Betrayed - was glad to have a rest,

He looked for girls without passion And left them all with none compassion,

Did not remember love and spite, Behaved like some indifferent guy

For evening whist who’s coming briskly, Sits down, plays not very hard,

Then gets he out of the yard, At home falls asleep too quickly,

At dawn who never knows yet The evening where will he spend.

XI

Onegin got Tatyana’s message. It quickly touched his soul’s strings:

For all his thoughts it was a passage - Unusual tongue of maiden’s dreams.

In thoughts her face too pale he found, She often seemed to be cast down;

And into sweet and sinless dream By soul he was getting in.

Of old times the heat of feeling, May be, could capture for a while;

He didn’t want to cheat meanwile The trusting heart of pure being.

For garden now we shall fleet In which she’s got with him to meet.

XII

Some minutes they were silent both, Onegin then to her came up

And. told her:

‘To me you wrote, Do not deny.

I’ve read it up:

Of trusting soul hard confessions, Of pure love such good expressions;

I can your frankness estimate, It made my feelings agitate

And passions which were mute and heartless; To praise yet you l don’t want;

For it I shall repay a lot By my admission, truly artless;

All my confessions must you take: For judgement yours I give my fate.

XIII

‘If I would wish to have restricted My life by family, you see,

If by my lot I were convicted A husband, father just to be,

If by the family best vision For instant I’d be charmed with reason,-

Believe, I’d never try anew To look for better bride but. you.

I’ll simply say without fevers: If previous idol I could find,

Alone you, to speak my mind, I’d take as friend of days my grievous,

Of all the charming for the bail And would be happy... till I fail!

XI

‘I’m not quite made to be much happy. My soul’s alien for bliss;

Perfections yours make speech my gappy, Of them I’m not yet worthy, miss.

Believe (for bail I give my conscience), The wedlock will be poignant nonsense.

I might be deeply loving you, But getting used I’d run from you;

Your tears, if you will be crying, Would never touch my gloomy heart,

But they would madden it too hard.

What roses, you can be judging,

For us fine Hymen now makes And maybe yet for many days.

XV

‘In all the world its most badly To see in family the wife

Who’s waiting for her husband sadly Alone daily all her life.

That she is good, dull husband knows But at has fate he curses throws,

He’s always frowned, taciturn, He’s chilly, jealous, angry turned!

That’s what I am.

Indeed, you won’t With all your pure flaming heart

Be glad with such a man… You smart With rare wit your letter wrote!

Indeed, d’you have this kind of mate Destined to your severe. fate?

XVI

‘My dreams and years won’t rather Return to make me new a bit,

I love you, but with love of brother And may be tenderer indeed.

You listen but without anger: With time young girl will change her temper,

Her easy dreams by other dreams; As well as trees can change the leaves

In early spring of every year.

You see, by skies its predestined:

You’ll fall in love once more and find… You learn to rule yourself: I fear

Not any man can grasp such things; Ignorance many troubles brings’

XVII

This way my Eugene was her teaching.

Through tears never seeing him,

Without breath, with timid feeling Tatyana listened then to him.

He gave his hard; in all her grievance (As they would say, it was unwitnessed)

Tatyana silently curl lean, Her languid head she bent to him;

Through kitchen-garden they went home; They came together; no one

Did try to make of that some fun: The country’s freedom has its own

And happy rights for own self Like haughty Moscow itself.

XVIII

And you agree, my dear reader: This time like real gentleman

With dear Tanya he was eager Himself to show honest man,

Revealed his own soul simple, Meanwhile malevolance of people

With him was always on the bends: His enemies as well as friends

(It is the same for people simple) To curse him tried this way and that.

Each man has enemies, but yet From friends defend us God a little

Ah, many friends were near then!

With reason I remembered them.

XIX

And what?

It’s right.

I simply wrote Of idle, blackish dreams of mine;

In brackets I would like to note: You haven’t more insulting lie,

By liars secretly prepared, By worldly mob in chorus favoured,

And no nonsense in the world Or epigram with brutal word

Which friend of yours with smile of terror In circles decent, so right,

Without purpose or a spite Would not repeat for days in error;

With might and main he’ll you defend With love of kinsman, not of friend!

XX

H’m, h’m! You, generous my readers, Are all your kinsfolk o’key?

You let me now my ideas To tell you all this very day.

What does the kinsfolk mean namely?

It means the following thing mainly:

We must all time all them caress, Respect and love at heart, not less;

And by the people’s usual custom On Christmas must we come to see;

To be the rest of year free Congratulations are accustomed;

We them remind about us...

And let them God long live for us!

XXI

But then, the love of tender beauties More trusty is than friendship, kin,

And you have right to it, not duties, Among rebellious storms, I mean,

It’s right, of course, but trends of fashion, But of the nature willful pressure,

Opinions of the worldly might...

And fair sex like down’s slight...

Besides, opinions of the husband By very good and virtuous wife

Most be respected for the life. And true girl-friend in love’s adjustment

Sometimes allured is for days: With love the Satan jokes makes.

XXII

But whom to love?

Whom you’d be trusting?

Who’s that, which never us betrays?

Who’s helpfully for us adjusting His own deeds and when he prays,

Who helps from slander not to perish?

Who carefully us can cherish?

To whom my vice is not a harm?

Who never bores us by his charm?

By those phantoms he, vain seeker, Should not in vain exhaust himself:

You first of alt must love yourself, My dear venerable reader!

Such subject’s worthy of your mind: More gentle never you will find.

XXIII

What was the sequence of the meeting?

Alas, it’s easy to divine!

Of love mad sufferings she’s feeling . Without ceasing for a while

In young sad soul’s aspirations; And yet much more with dismal passions

Tatyana poor is in heat; in bed she never falls asleep;

The health, the prime of life, its sweetness, The smile, the innocent calm ease,-

Ali that has gone like sound’s fizz, And dear Tanya’s youth all dwindles:

The shade of coming storm this way Is darkening all the breaking day.

XXIV

Alas, Tatyana’s daily fading: She’s paling, sinking and is mute,

She’s nothing ever entertaining, For life she wouldn’t give a hoot..

All heads are now grandly shaking The neighbours whisper (they are wailing):

It’s time, its time to marry her!

But it’s enough to speak of her:

I’d cheer up imagination By picture where love yet strives.

Unwittingly, you see, the lives Confuse yet me with incarnation;

Forgive me, but my love is deep To Tanya’s dear heart indeed.

XXV

Each minute more is captivated By Olga’s beauty so young,

By bondage Lensky’s fascinated, Gave up his soul to the fun.

With her he’s ever in her chamber Until the daylight turns more fainter;

Or in the garden hand in hand They walk at morning so grand;

And what?

By love intoxicated, Embarrassed by the tender shame,

Sometimes he dares like in game, By smile of Olga animated,

To play by her untwisted lock, To kiss the edge of Olga’s frock.

XXVI

Sometimes to Olga he is reading With morals novel for herself,

Whose author bolter nature’s feeling Than Chateaubriand does himself.

Meanwhile some two or three of pages (Some idle gibberish or fables,

But dangerous for the maiden’s heart) Quite reddenning he’s missing up.

They are alone far from people, Are playing at the board of chess,

On table leaning with slight press, Are sitting, lost in thought. a little,

And own pawn with own rook Distracted Lensky there took,

XXVII

When he’s at home, always there By Olga is he kept all day.

Of album leaflets with his care To decorate he works away;

In them he draws the country whole, The Kyprid’s temple, graves alone:

Or on the lyre draws a dove With pens and paints, with all his love;

Or on the leaves for recollections, Of other signatures beneath

His own tender verse he leaves Like monument to his affections,

Of instant thought some slight a trace, But of the same for years race.

XXVIII

Of course, for times you have been seeing A country maiden’s album big,

Which by the girl-friends had been scribbling From start, from end in any twig.

In it, in spite of rules of spelling Excessive verse, as they are telling,

As sign of friendship’s written in, Continued, lessened for the whim.

The first of leaflets just can show: Qu’ecrirez-vous sur ces tablettes;

It’s signed by t.a.v.

Annette; And on the last one you read so:

Who loves you more than I can do Must here write a verse anew.

XXIX

Without fail you’ll find them here: Two hearts, the blooms, the torch’s rays;

You’ll find some vowes to the dear To love her until dying days.

Some poet from ranks of army Signed verse of villaine, though charming.

To such an album, being tight, If to confess, I’d like to write,

With all my soul being sure That any rubbish, done with zeal,

Will get some favourable deal, And afterwards they’ll not endure

Maliciously discuss with smiles: If I was sharp or dull in lies,

XXX

But uncoordinated volumes From devil’s library all got,

And albums perfect but enormous, Of stylish rhymers racking lot,

You all, whom decorated guickly Tolstoy with brush such wondrous, sweatily,

Or Baratinsky with his pen,- Let be you birnt by thunder then!

When some respiended dear lady To give in quatro me yet tries,

I am engulfed by trembling vice: An epigram is being ready

At bottom of my soul fast... But give them madrigal at last!

XXXI

Not madrigals my Lensky’s writing In Olga’s album, and indeed

His pen with love is always sighing Without coolness of the wit:

He writes of all that he can hear Or see of Olga in the near,

And full of truth which he can meet His elegies like rivers fleet.

Thus you, Yazykov, always wrote In gust of passion of your heart,

God knows, whom by words you dart; Of elegies the precious code

Sometimes will give you all the rate Of all your own real fate.

XXXII

But hist!

D’you hear?

Critic strictly Demands from us: be getting rid

Of elegy’s bad garland quickly; To all the rhymers, friends indeed,

He shouts: ‘Stop your own crying And croaking the same, and whining,

And always pity of the past; Enough, of other sing you fast!’

-it’s right, but may be you will show The pipe, the dagger and the man;

Of thoughts dead capital again To raise from dead you’ll give a hope;

Is not it so, friend?

- Not, then!

You write the odes, gentlemen,

XXXIII

As they them wrote many years Of might, as it through ages came..’

-Just solemn odes you could hear!

Enough, my friend, its all the same!

-What said the satirist, remember!

Is cunning liric, who can render

The ‘else’s trends’, for you the best Among dull rhymers and the rest? -

‘But all the elegies are mere A trifle, aimless idle talk,

Meanwhile they most be not a mock, But honourable..!’ - l could here

Give arguments, but I do not: To quarrel ages don’t want.

XXXIV

Adorer of the glory, freedom, Immersed in own stormy thought,

Vladimir could have odes written, - To road them Olga never got.

Did happen any bard in tears To deer love to read with fears

His own works?

They say, they’d got For that the best in world reward.

Indeed, he’s blessed, the lover tranquil, Who can explain his own dreams

To object of his love and hymns, To beauty dear, nicely languid.

He’s blessed... But may be she has been Amused by other, not by him.

XXXV

But I my fruits of dreams am reading, And my harmonious ventured verse

Alone to my nurse, who’s being My old friend from youth and forth.

And after rather tedious dinner, When I, refreshing own inner,

Could catch a neighbour, who by chance Came in - by tragedy at once Him entertained.

Without jokes By bore and rhyme depressed, all day

I’m hiking round pretty lake, Some flocks of ducks by chance awoke,

And listening Id my singing rhyme From banks they all together fly.

XXXVI, XXXVII

And what’s Onegin doing?

Brothers!

I ask: be patient for a time;

His everyday employments rather In details I should well describe.

In summer Eugene lived like hermit: Past six was getting up in hamlet,

And to the river, lightly clad Beneath the mounting he went;

The Gulnare’s singer imitating Across this Hellespont could swim:

At home coffee used to drink; Were poor journals for him waiting.

And then he dressed himself...

XXXVIII, XXXIX

A sound sleep, the walks, the reading. The forest shade, of brooks the hiss, -

Sometimes with pretty girl a meeting, A young and fresh unwaited kiss,

The horse for rider proved obedience, The dinner rather well fastidious,

A bottle of some light sweet wine, Some solitude, the stillness fine:

Onegin’s life is somewhat sacred; And he, unfeeling, was to it

All given up in summer heat. To count days he simply hated,

Forgot the town and the friends, And boredom of the festive blends.

XL

But all the nothern Russian summer Of south winter bad burlesque:

Appeared-vanished quickly rather, We gee, but don’t we. confess.

With autumn skies were dayly breathing, Not every day the sun was gleaming,

Each day was shorter at the noon, The secret canopy of wood

With grievous noise became all naked, The tog was falling on the fields,

The caravan of crying geese For south fleeted. And unwaited

The time was coming, dull and hard: November stood in front of yard.

XLI

At break of dawn the night is cold; In cornfields work has ceased away;

With his she-wolf, in hunger bold, A wolf is coming to the way;

Him scenting, horses on the road All snort, and travellers quickly hold:

You’d better hurry up away. The shepherd at the break of day

Does not make cows go out, And when at noon they are forlone,

He doesn’t gather them with horn. A maiden’s singing in her house,

She spins; a friend of winter night The splinter’s crackling making light.

XLII

But nowadays the frosts are crackling (A rhyme for cra.ckling, one foresees;

Its here: take it and be ‘tackling’ !) All look like silver snowy fields...

More pretty than a parquette fashioned, The river, clad in ice, is flashy,

And many boys with joyful cries Are scaring on sonorous ice;

On reddish paws a goose, such heavy, To get to waters wants to swim:

With care steps on icy brim And slips, and falls; all fluffy, merry

The snowflakes are flashing, whirl, Like stars at river’s banks they fall.

XLIII

Such time what can you do in village?

To walk?

The seasons country views

Unwittingly may bore by image Of its monotonous naked hues.

To ride a horse in steppe severe?

But then your horse will try in fear

To scratch unfaithful icy path As he’s afraid to fall at last.

Deserted room alone filling You read; it’s Pradt, it’s Walter Scott.

You don’t want? - check up your cost, Or grudge, or drink, and thus the evening

Will pass away more fast, they tell, And you will pass the winter well.

XLIV

Like Harold Child Onegin’s fallen Into the thoughtful lazy haze:

From bed to icy bath had fallen And afterwards was whole days

Engaged alone with accounts; Or, taking cue like somewhat armours,

At own billiard with two balls He played from morning one for all.

But when to country comes the evening The billiard, cues are left again,

At fire-place the table’s lain: Onegin’s waiting - Lensky’s speeding

On roan horses, three abrest; Arid let’s have dinner before rest!

XLV

Of ‘Clicquot widow’ or ‘Moet` Some blessed and fine the dry white wine

In icy bottle for the poet Sometimes is brought at proper time.

I — It sparkles by Hippocrene’s role, It was by own play and foam

(Which seemed to be like this and that) Me captivating; and for that

I last and poor mite was giving For you myself, remember this;

But its magestic merry fizz Caused foolishness and some misgiving,

And many verses, jokes, whims, And arguments, and merry dreams.

XLVI

But it betrays with froth imprudent My stomack. I have never sought

It now; but ‘Bordeaux’ prudent To-day to others nave prefered.

Some wines to me are not ajusted, Remind a lady-lover rusted,

Which’s shiny, windy and alive, But selfish, idle, thirsts for thrive.

And you, ‘Bordeaux’ you came friendly, Like friend in trouble and in grief,

You are like comrade, 1 believe, To help are ready always gently,

Can share stillness of pastimes; Long live

‘Bordeaux’ all the times!

XLVII

The fire’s dead; and under ashes Like gold is the coal’s crust;

A jet of steam yet hardly flashes, its whirling, vanishes at last.

The fire-place is fading...

Smoke From pipes to chimney flies.

A bowl

On table’s hissing yet, forlorn...

The evening darkness comes along...

I like the friendly idle speakings And friendly howl of sweet wine

(At season, which is called meanwhile The time of wolf and dog for meetings,

But why? I don’t grasp it yet). And now friends enjoy a chat..

XLUIII

‘But how are Tatyana, neighbours, And Olga, frisky pretty girl?’

- To pour half-glass you do a favour...

Enough, my dear...

Healthy all...

Regards of them to you I’m giving.

Ah, dear, all my inner feeling

Adores my Olga: figure, breast!

You’ll see: they all become the bosh

Let’s visit them; you’ll be obliging: Or otherwise you judge yourself:

You came two times, but then of self You don’t make them yet reminding

And thus... But what a fool I am I They call you: come next week to them.-

XLIX

‘Me?’ - Yes, Tatyana’s name-day happy Will be on Saturday...

They call, And no reason, even gappy, You have for not to come at all.-

‘But they will have a throng of people And all the other rabble feeble..?.

-But no one...

Pm sure... none, They’ll be the family, the one.

Let’s go, do thorn such a favour!

And what? -

‘Agreed’ - You... dear guy!

And saying so, made he dry A glass to health of dear neighbour,

And then was speaking of the same: Of Olga, dear love, again!

L

With joy he knew: for wedding carriage Two weeks ahead was fixed above.

The secrets of the bed of marriage, The garlands of the sweetest love

For his delight were just awaiting.

But Hymen’s troubles, griefs of mating,

The yawnings, other cold things He never saw in any dreams.

Meanwhile we all. of Hymen foes, In home life yet see but one

And boring pictures’ row, done In style of La Fontaine’s sweet novels.

My poor Lensky with his heart For such a life was born, young bard.

LI

He was beloved.., at least was grateful To have such hope like a balm.

A hundred times is blessed, who’s faithful. Who’s got his wit to be quite calm,

Reposes in heart contentment Like drunkard, spending night for payment,

Or tenderer - like little moth Which sucks spring flower with force;

But wretched is, who’s all foreseeing, Who never felt some ache of head,

Who hates the moving and the word When you translate him their meaning;

Whose knowledge makes his heart all cool Arid him forbids to play the foolt

CHAPTER FIVE

Oh, don’t know dreadful dreams You, my young Svetlana

Zhookovsky

I

That year pretty autumn weather Too long was staying on in yard,

The winter had been longed by nature, In January it snowed hard.

On day the third at early morning Tatyana saw and was adoring:

The yard was under snow dense: Parterres, roofs and all the fence;

The panes with patterns are like marvel, By snow flocks are covered trees,

Some merry magpies Tanya sees, All mountains were smoothly covered

By winter carpets, snow-made.

All’s blight, all’s white without shade.

II

It’s winter!..

Young triumphant peasant On wooden sledge renews the way.

His horse the snow feels at present, Its trotting, lazily away.

A brave sledge-cart from field’s returning, It’s fluffy furrows upturning,

The coachman’s on -box with lash In sheepskin coat and red sash.

A yard boy’s running in the middle, He made his dog in sledge to sit

While he prefered to play a steed. His finger’s frozen a little,

It hurts, he laughs, through window-panes At him his mother’s finger shakes.

III

But may be those kinds of pictures By now can’t you all attract,

As they are mean and simple features, You won’t see fine art in that.

But blessed by God of inspiration Another one in. rhymes of fashion.

Described for us the snowfall, {l5} The winter’s bliss and tinges all:

He’ll fascinate you, I am sure, By picturing in flaming verse

The secret drives in sledge rehearse; But I am ready to endure

The peaceful life with him and you, Who pictured Finnish frosts anew.

IV

Tatyana (Russian in her soul, Herself she doesn’t know why)

With all her cooling beauty lone Did like the Russian winter fine:

The rime on frosty days yet sunlit; And sledges; and before the sunset

The snow’s rose shining charm; On Christmas evenings hazy calm.

Of old age triumphant customs At home were supported hard:

All servant maidens in the yard To guess the fortune were accustomed,

Each year guessed for misses much: From army husbands and the march.

V

Tatyana trusted legend’s fancies Of simple folk’s old times.

And dreams as well as cartomancies, The moons predictions in the skies.

By many signs she’s always worried, In secret way all objects hurried

To tell her something of the rest; Misgivings hardly squeezed her breast.

If mincing cat, on stove sitting, While purring could his muzzle wash,

For her the truthful sign it was That guests are coming.

If she’s seeing

A young two-horned the moon at sky, But at unusual left the side,

VI

She all is trembling, paling, shying.

And when a falling shining star

Along the darkish sky is flying To scatter in the sky afar,

In great confusion she is hastening, While falling star yet isn’t fading,

The wish of heart to whisper her.

And when sometimes in front of her

A monk in black by chance appears, Or quick a hare in the fields

Her way is crossing, then she feels Herself embarrased; and of tears,

Of sad misgivings she is full, Foresees misfortunes as a rile.

VII

Well, she had found charming secret In sense of horror by itself:

Each one by nature is restricted By contradictions in himself.

The Christmas tide for joy is coming!

To guess the windy youth is trying

Which doesn’t pity any things, In front of which the life yet is

Immense and light, at distance waiting; Through glasses old people guess

The end of life; of loss confess With no hopes for regaining:

But all the same, the hope them With baby-talk is lying then.

VIII

Tatyana’s interest is affected By melting on the fire wax:

It shows traceries affective, Informs of mind’s the secret backs.

From saucers, filled with clear waters Some rings get out as on trotters

To her they gave a little ring, An old song began to sing:

All peasants-men there are enriching, They get the silver with a spade,

We sing of their lucky fate And glory!

- All they are yet feeling

Some loss in all the song’s refrains: The song of cat is best for maids.

IX

The night is frosty, skies are clear, Of all the heaven’s bodies light

All flows in a single gear...

Tatyana to the yard, such wide,

In open light dress comes out, At moon her mirror’s aiming down,

But darkish mirror can reflect The trembling moon alone yet...

The snow’s crackling... someone’s near... On her tiptoe fast she flies

And asks him stilly, sweetly sighs More tenderer than reed-pipe dear:

What is your name? - He’s looking on, At last he answers: - Aghaphon…

X

Tatyana took advice of nanny; As she in bath-room had to guess

She ordered secretly her granny: Prepare table for a guest...

At once was frightened my Tatyana...

And I, while thinking of Swetlana,

Was too afraid, I must confess...

But with Tatyana shan’t we guess.

Her belt of silk she is removing, Undressed is going to bed,

And Lei is soaring above head: And under pillow unmoving

Her maiden’s mirror yet she keeps.

It all is still.

Tatyana steeps.

XI

Tatyana has a dream unknown: As if she lone were to get

Across a glade, all under snow Around which all’s dark and sad.

In snow-drifts in front of maiden A stream is boiling, all is raging,

Makes noise, is dark and grey, quite lost Yet isn’t frozen by frost.

Two poles glued by halves of floe (Disastrous, trembling little aid)

Across the torrent have been laid. In front of noisy gulf of flow,

By deep embarrassment fulfilled She has to stop, she’s standing still.

XII

As at the reason of the parting Tatyana’s grumbling at the brook,

She doesn’t see yet any party Which could be helpful in the hook.

The snow-drift at once is moving...

And who, d’you think, from it is looking?

Some big and shaggy bear comes .. Tatyana: ‘Ah!’ But he becomes

Polite; with sharp-clawed paw he’s rapping Her hand to offer help; she bends

And leans on him with trembling hands; All fearful she’s shyly stepping

But crosses bridge; her helping her: She runs… the bear’s after her!

XIII

Of looking back she doesn’t dare And hurries up, she’s quickening steps,

But from. the shaggy lackey-bear She cannot get away, She flaps:

The bear drags behind and groans; In front of them she sees and moans:

A forest stands; a stout pine Is still and frowned, yet is fine

With flocks of snow; through the crowns Of naked birches from the sky

The heaven’s bodies beam and shine. The bushes, chutes without bounds

Are snow-bound by the storm. In depth of snow are forlorn.

XIV

She runs for forest... he’s about; The flabby snow is knee-deep;

Her neck was caught by long a bough, Then branches could her ears meet

And rent the ear-rings of gold; Then brittle snows fastly hold

Her summer shoes quite wet through all; Then she her handkerchief lets fall.

To take it up she can’t, in fear Of bear: he about hangs;

And even by her trembling hands To lift her dress ashamed she's here;

She’s running - he is after her; She can’t be running any more,

XV

She falls on snow - he is swifty: He’s taking her in paws and brings,

And she insensibly is drifting, She doesn’t move and doesn’t breathe;

He speeds her up the forest road; Through trees is seen a dwelling old,

It’s in the backwoods and it all Is bound by the snow-fall,

Its window is brightly shining, Inside much noise and fuss they’ve had;

‘There is my crony, he said, To warm yourself you must be trying!’

To inner porch he goes fast, He’s laying down her at last.

X U1

When she recovered she is looking: Some inner porch... the bear's gone;

She hears rings of glasses, hooping Like at the funeral great, long.

Not seeing any use of porches Through chink she now stilly watches;

What does she see? that at the boards Are sitting spooks of any sorts:

One’s horned, with muzzle of a hound; Another has of cock the head;

With goat’s beard sits a hag; She sees sceleton stiff and proud,

A dwarf with tail; and there’s that Who’s half-a-crane and half-a-cat.

XVII

But that’s more wonderful and dreadful: A crayfish on a spider rides,

At goose’s neck a skull is fateful, It’s whirling round for all sides;

A mill is squatting in the dancing, By wings it crackles, flaps, is glancing.

They bark and laugh, they whistle, clap, They sing and speak, like horses stamp:

But what Tatyana could he thinking When recognized among the guests

Her love but fright nevertheless, Main person of this novel pretty!

Onegin’s sitting at the board By stealth is looking at the door.

XVIII

He makes a sign and all they bother; He drinks and all they drink and cry;

He laughs - they all are laughing further: He frowns - all are srient, wry.

That he’s the head - it all is clear And Tanya has much less of fear;

Of interest she is now full And tries herself the door to pull…

But suddenly the wind has blown Away the lire of all lamps:

Are troubled house-spirit gangs; Onegin’s eyes make tire own,

He’s rumbling, quickly he gets up, For door he nears, ail got up.

XIX

She got afraid and in a hurry Tatyana tries away to fly

And can’t; she’s now deeply worrier!, She moans and she’d like to cry...

But can’t: through door her Eugene enters; In front of eyes of Hades’ spectres

The girl appeared! Laugh was wild!. They all stood gaping for a while,

Then hoofs, wry trunks, it let alone The tufted tails, the fangs in mugs,

The whiskers and the bloody tongues, The horns and fingers made of bone -

All point at her, such young and fine, And all they cry: ‘It’s mine! Its mine’

XX

‘It’s mine!’ the voice of Eugene thunders! And all the gang has vanished fast.

She stayed in frosty tone darkness: Young maiden is with Him at last.

Onegin stilly her is helping And in the corner is her laying

On shaky bench, and own head To Tanya’s shoulder he bends;

But suddenly her sister’s coming, Then Lensky comes; the light has flashed;

With threat Onegin raised his hand And wildly with his eyes is shining;

He curses all unbidden guests; And half alive she can’t have breath..

XXI

They argue louder; he’s getting Some long a knife; in short a while

He’s killing Lensky; horrid shading Lays down, then a dreadful cry

Is heard; the dwelling all is shaking...

In horror Tanya is awaking...

She sees: the room is light again, Through window’s a frosty pane

Of dawn the ray all crimson sparkles And Olga opens the door;

Like North Aurora’s face of her, And like a butterfly she flutters.

‘But now tell;’ she says, ‘to me: Whom did you see in dream with me?’

XXII

At sister Tanya isn’t looking; She lies in bed; a book she has

And leaf by leaf through it is looking But nothing to her sister says...

This kind of book yet doesn’t show The writer’s fancies in a row,

Nor pictures nor a wisdom thought That Virgin or Racine had got,

Nor Scott, nor Byron, nor Seneka; The Lady’s Fashion Journal had

Less influence on lady’s head; It was, my friends, Martyn Zadeka,

The head of Chaldean wise men, — Of dreams the fortune-teller then.

XXIII

This thoughtful, interesting creation By travelling merchant them was brought

One day to their isolation And for Tatyana they then bought:

Malvina’s works but separated For several roubles he abated,

And in addition gave to them Collection of plain fables then, With them two Pentads, a grammar.

Marmontel’s volume them he gave.

Martin Zadeka then became The pet of Tanya, and forever

He comforts her in all her griefs And constantly with her he sleeps.

XXIV

That dream aroused her misgivings.

Not grasping ways to understand

Of dreadful fancy all the meanings Tatyana wants to find the end.

In book’s short contents, finds she out Some words that should explain about

The dreams: fir-trees, the hag, the bores, The East, the bear, snow-storms

Etcetera.

Her real doubt Zadeka never could resolve!

Her dream is sinister, it all At sad adventures pointed out.

And several days she after that Had been entroubled, deeply sad.

XXV

By crimson hand not seen by now The dawn from morning towards the lay

Has brought. the sun and anyhow The merry festival name-day .

An Lane’s home from the morning Is full of guests, of kin adoring:

All neighbours came by closed sleigh, By hooded carts, by britzkas, sledge...

In afternoon they squash and crowd, In drawing room they meet new face;

The barks, the smacks of kissing maids, The crush, the laugh, the noise are loud.

All bow, shuffle, gladly smile, Wet-nurses scream, the babies cry.

XXVI

With own wife that’s very portly Came stout Pustyakov at last;

Gvozdin, good master, who could shortly Make beggars of his peasants fast.

Grey-haired couple of Scotinin With all the children you’d be seeing

From two to thirty years on; The district dandy Petushkóv,

With him my cousin first Buyánov, All fuzzy, wears peaky cap,

(Of course you him alredy met;) And counsellor retired Flyánov,

The greatest gossip, old cheat, The glutton, grafter, fool a bit.

XXVII

With Kharlikóv Panfíl and children Monsieur Triquet arrived, a wit,

Who left Tambóv without hindrance, He wears glasses, brown wig.

In pocket he, as Frenchman real, Has brought for his Tatyana dear,

The lilt, well known round me: Reveilles vous, belle endormie.

Among the songs in books decrepit Somewhere issued was that lilt; Triquet with poet’s keen wit For world from dust that rhyme extracted,

Was brave instead of ‘elle Nina’ To put the ‘belle Tatiana’

XXVIII

By now from a distant village The idol of the ladies ripe,

For district mothers pleasant image - The regimental chief arrived.

He came, What news, such sentimental!

Well have the music regimental!

The colonel sent it for the chance.

What joy: to-day we’ll have to dance!

The girls are jumping all around.

Its time for dinner, Guests have had

To come to tables hand in hand.

Around Tanya ladies crowd,

The men confront. All cross in peace. The throng, all humming, takes the seats.

XXIX

The talks are saved for time much better: The mouths chew, From every side

The plates and covers jointly clatter, The glasses clink, all filled with wine.

But in a while the guests from suburb Are making up a common hubbub:

They don’t listen to, they cry, They argue, laugh and squeak in fright.

And suddenly my Lensky enters, With hire Onegin.

‘Ah, my Lord!’,

The mistress cries, ‘At last you’ve got!’

In crowd everybody renders:

They take away the chairs, plates, Them call, they give the friends a place.

XXX

Against Tatyana in a row They sit. Of morning moon more pale

She’s trembling like persued a doe, Her darkening eyes she hides away

From them: she new blazes greatly, She feels herself in passion badly;

She’s deaf for greetings of the friends; To hide her tears quickly bends

Her head; is seeming to be ready For deep a faint, this being mild;

But will and power of mind All overcame, and she already

Some words, yet stilly, tries to say, But at the table could she stay.

XXXI

For long Onegin couldn't bear That tragical and nervous mood

Of girls, the tears, faints not rare: Enough he had them all en route.

Like crank by chance at feast enormous He’s angry.

And Tatyana’s nervous

And trembling state is seen by him; All vexed, he’s being in a whim.

He’s puffing, he is remonstrating, He swore to devil Lensky’s head For sufferings, he here had.

Already for triumph he’s waiting,

And he invents by whim’s requests Caricatures of the guests.

XXXII

Of course, Onegin’s not alone, Who saw her disarray in eyes,

But aim of looks and talks on whole That time at feast are fatty pies

(Unhappily, too much all salted). But. with the help of resin bottled,

Between blancmanger and roasts fine They now bring the Tsimlyan wine.

With narrow and long wine-glasses, Reminding slander waist of yours,

Zhizhi, my soul’s crystal first, The subject of naive my passes,

Enticing goblet for my love, Its you, who made me drunk with love,

XXXIII

And now, free from humid stopper, Each bottle bangs and all the wine

Can hiss; with bearings important, By couplets tortured all the time,

Triquet gets up; the whole meeting The deepest silence now’s keeping.

Tatyana hardly sighs, the man Addresses her with verse in hand

And falsely sings, Applauds and crying Are greeting him.

And she has had

To reverence for singing that; The poet, such great but shying.

To her is drinking first, his rhyme He gives to Tanya at that time.

XXXIV

For greetings and congratulations She gives each one her thankful look.

But when her thanks for termination To Eugene came, tier languid mood,

Embarrassment, her being tired Arosed pity, he’s admired;

He mutely bowed to the girl, His gaze somehow was in all

Such charming, tender.

Was she feeling; That he then really was moved,

Or, like coquette, he simply boomed? By his good will Or willy-nilly

He showed tenderness. Such start Enlivens poor Tama’s heart.

XXXV

The driven chairs noise arouse; All throng has rushed to anter-room

As well as bees from tasty house With noise are flying for the bloom

All satisfied at feast by dinner The neighbours puff in room, the inner;

The ladies sit at fire-place; You see in corners whispering maids;.

Green tables are prepaired now, All active players they invite:

For boston, lomber come in sight, For whist, well famous until now.

They all are family the same, The sons of greedy bore at game.

XXXVI

They now play the eighth of roberts, Of whist the braves; eight times in line

They all replaced for each of roberts; The tea’s been brought.

I could define

The time of day by tea or dinner, Or supper.

Every country eater

Can know time without fuss: The stomach is the watch for us.

In brackets to the point I’d note: In all my verses, by my rhyme

About feasts, enormous, fine, About meals and corks I wrote

Like idol, - you, Omir divine, - For three millenniums in line,

XXXVII, XXXVIII, XXXIX

The tea’s been brought; the quiet maidens Are taking saucers into hand,

At once behind the door awakens The sound of bassoon from band:

Enjoyed by thunder of the music From tea with rum at once refusing,

The Pans of the district girls, With Olga Petushkóv then whirls,

With Tanya Lensky; Kharlikóva, The bride of more than ripening age,

By hard from big Tambóv’s engaged; Buyhánov whirls with Pustyakóva,

The rest all gathered at the hail: Of ball the beuaty shines for all.

XL

At the beginning of my novel — (In chapter first you look it all)

I’d like to use the Alban’s model: In Petersburg to show ball.

But then, amused by idle dreamings, Attended to my better feelings

Of known ladies feet and legs.

But by your narrow small tracks,

Ah, feet, in vain I was affected.

The further I’m from youth my gay,

The wiser I should get each day: My deeds and rhymes to have corrected,

And even this my chapter five — From all digressions to refine.

XLI

Monotonous and sometimes yet senseless, Like whirlwind of the youthful lives,

The waltz is whirling; noisy, taintless, A couple after couple flies.

The time revengeful now nears, In secret Eugene gaily sneers,

Comes up to Olga: several jests, And they are whirling near guests.

Then he for her a chair’s finding, They speak about this and that,

And several minutes after that With her the waltz again he’s dancing.

All are amazed, my Lensky sighs, Does not believe his own eyes.

XLII

Mazurka’s sounding.

It happened. When thunder of mazurka came,

The halls enormous is all then trembled, The parquet’s cracks wee heard again.

The frames were shaking, trembling there But nowadays the men, like fair

Young ladies on the floor all glide But yet in towns, countryside

Mazurka now all its rating, Initiative beauties keeps:

The jumps, moustache, the clicks of heels Are all the same without changing

By worst of modes: modern fuss, Which is a tyrant for us.

XLIII, XLIV

Buyánov, my quick-temperd brother, To Eugene brought two girls at once:

With Olga Tanya; quickly rather Onegin Olga took for dance.

He rules her, but neglectly gliding, And, bending, whispers her his finding:

Some madridgal of old days, And presses hand; at once her face

In proud, touching inflammation Is blushing crimson.

Lensky saw

All those changes. All the more He, full of jealous indignation,

Is waiting for the end of dance, And for cotillion her invites.

XLV

But yet she can’t.

And what’s the reason?

Ah, Olga gave the word to him,

Onegin.

Goodness me, it isn’t For him to hear!

What a whim...

Impossible!?

She’s mere infant, But yet coquette! A giddy instance!

And. so cunny, she is gay. Already’s able to betray!

He can’t endure such a blow; The whims of women he can curse.

Gets out, asks for own horse And rides.

Two pistols in a row,

Two bullets - fitting at this rate - Will quickly settle all his fate.

CHAPTER SIX

La, sotto i giorni nubilosi e brevi, 			Nasce una gente a cui i’morir non dole.

Petrarka 			Where days are cloudy and short 			A tribe was there born 			For which to die makes no hurt. (It.)

I

But when Vladimir disappeared, Onegin, languished by the bore,

Was lost in thought; to Olga near Revengeful words said no more.

And Olga’s yawning; round here She’s looking for her Lensky dear.

For her cotillion now seems Like long and heavy dreadful dreams,

At last it stopped.

All have the supper.

The beds are made. And any guest

Has own place to have a rest, From porch to maiden’s.

All they utter

A need for sleep.

Onegin my To sleep at home lone flied.

II

All’s now calm; in rooms you hear: Is snoring heavy Pustyakóv

With own heavy hall, his dear; Gvozdín, Buyánov, Petushkóv

And Flyanov who is not quite healthy, On chairs in a room are wealthy.

Monsieur Triquet is on the floor, In jersey, capped, not far from door.

In Tanya’s, Olga’s rooms all maidens Already happy dreams have had;

At window alone, sad (Diana’s ray lights up, her wakens)

My poor Tanya sits, can’t sleep, And looks into the darkling field.

III

By his anwaited apparition, By instant tenderness of eyes,

By got by Olga strange tuition She’s touched, in depth of soul sighs;

She’s been embarrassed, cannot now Him understand yet anyhow;

She’s troubled by the jealous trend: As if some cold foe’s hand

Can press her heart, or a misfortune, That waits for her, is black, makes noise.

‘I’ll perish, - says my Tanya’s voice - From him to die is pleasant fortune.

I don’t grudge: why should I grudge?

He can’t give happiness at large’.

IV

But forward, forward, you, my story!

My muse new person just reveals.

Some several miles from Krasnogóry, From Lensky’s village, there lives

And is alive yet for the present, In philosophical sense desert,

Zarétsky, brawler; they believe: Of gambling gang he was the chief,

The chief of rakes, a tribune-tippler. — Hut now simply good the head

Of family; not married yet; A real friend, a landlord, ripper;

To honest people he belongs: This way the century reforms!

V

A smooth-tongued voice of world, it happened, His evil bravery could praise:

From pistol he, not being rattled, At fifteen metres stuck the ace.

But he at real field of action Himself white raptured by affection

Distinguished: bravely to the slush From Kalmyk horse he fell in rush.

Like drunkard tight by real Frenchmen Was captivated (dear lot!).

New Regulus (of honour God) Anew he could the bonds abandon:

At Verrey’s every morning’s time On credit drank three quarts of wine.

VI

He joked in a funny manner, Could fool an idiot for fun,

Could make of clever fool for ever, Explicit or implicit one.

Sometimes himself for tricks on others Was given lessons by the others;

Sometimes himself, not as a rule, Could he entrapped like real fool;

For merry dispute he was able To be in answers dull or sharp,

Sometimes could keep his answer dark; Sometimes a quarrel could enable

To make the friends embroiled become, Made friends to barrier to come;

VII

To have a breakfast three together Could make them quickly reconcile,

And then in secret could defame them By merry jest or real he.

‘Sed alia temporal’ But rudeness (Like dream of love, the prank of goodness)

With youthful years gets away, And my Zaretsky, I would say,

Behind accacias, bird cherries From storms is hidden in his den,

Can live like real wise a ma7i: Like that Horatius with cabbage

His geese and ducks tie breeds for fee And teaches children ABC.

VIII

He’s not a fool; Onegin, grudging, Did not respect the heart of his;

But liked the spirit of his judging, Judicious talks of that and this.

And he with pleasure long ago Was meeting him; that’s why at borne

Was not astonished at the dawn To see him coining to his hall;

But after first cordial greeting Zaretsky’s silent for a while

And to Onegin with wry smile From poet he gives for reading A leaf.

Onegin, standing up, At window it all read up.

IX

It was an honourable, pleasant A challenge, or cartel quite short,

It was polite and not discrepant: For duel Lensky called, in short.

Onegin at the first admission To agent of such secret mission

Returned; without extra word always ready - shortly said.

Zaretsky was explains refusing; To stay for long he didn’t want:

At home had to work a lot; And he went out; but my Eugene

Alone with his soul’s self Unsatisfied was by himself.

X

It serves him right: to think if strictly, If secret judge for him to call,

He was to blame at times more thickly: At first, he wasn’t right at all

That he at love such timid, tender Last evening joked like offender;

Then let the poet enraged To play the fool: at his teenage

It is forgivable.

Onegin Who loved the youth with all his heart

Himself should show as the hard Without prejudices heading

Not flaming boy for fighting fit But male with honour and the wit.

XI

He could his feelings there show But not to bristle like a beast.

No should disarm him long ago, That young a soul.

But at least

It’s late, the time has gone; his letter To rue was brought; the whole matter

Is spoiled by old duels fan, He’s evil, gossip, talking man...

Of course, he thinks, ‘I could be scornful To alt his funny, lying word;

But whisper, laugh of fools can hurt..’

Opinion of the public mournful!

The spring of honour, idol last!

Yet does it whirl the world and us:

XII

By eager enmity exited Vladimir for the answer waits.

Eloquent man, by him invited, Triumphantly the answer trails.

And now jealouser’s triumphant!

He was afraid of being answered

In form of merry, pretty jest With somewhat ruse, to have the breast

Of enemy from pistol parried.

But now doubts all are solved:

For mill they all have had resolved At dawn in time to come in carriage

With friend a pistol fight to launch, To aim at temple or at haunch.

XIII

As he to hate coquette decided Excited Lensky didn’t want

Before the fight to be invited... At watch, the sun he’s looking on...

At last he gave it up, and failing, Himself he found at her dwelling.

He thought she would be much confused, By his arrival much abused;

But riot at all: like long ago For poor bard is on the watch

His Olga’s jumping from the porch Like feather-brained and trail a hope:

She’s playful, careless and gay, Well, just the same as every day.

XIV

‘What for you early disappeared?’

Was asking Olya him at once

My Lensky’s feelings all were smeared, He was afraid at her to glance.

Annoyance, jealousy could vanish In front of eyes with clear relish,

In front of tenderness quite plain, In front of soul playful, frail...

He looks al her with tender ardour; He’s yet beloved with previous force,

He’s now languished by remorse, He’s being ready to beg pardon,

He’s trembling, loses fitting words, He’s happy, has improved his health,

XV, XVI, XVII

Again he, downcast and thoughtful, In front of dear Olga stands;

It seems to him like something awful To her remind all evening gaps.

He thinks of here:

‘I’ll be defender; I’ll not endure when offender

By fire of the praise and sighs To tempt the heart of girl yet tries:

Or when a worm disdained and deadly Is growing out lily’s stem

Of morning flower which then At halt of life must wither faintly’.

My Friends, you know, what it means: With friend of mine I’ve shooting things.

XVIII

Ah, if he knew, by what a cruel Offence. Tatyana’s heart was burnt!

It Tanya knew of near duel, At least the day before had heard

That Eugene and his friend Vladimir At dawn will argue their living

On earth, then might be by her love She’d joined the friends the day above!

But no man in all the district Could ever know of that fuss:

Onegin was as mute as dust, Tatyana pined for love in secret;

It could be known by the nurse But slow-witted all she was.

XIX

All evening Lensky was distracted, Was now silent, now gay;

The man, by muses once affected, As usual frowns alt the day.

At clavichords he had been sitting, But only for chords was fitting;

At Olga then he fixed his gaze And whispered: ‘I’ve my happy days...’

But it is late, it’s time to go...

His heart is pressed, fulfilled with bore,

At time of parting furthermore It beats like ready just to blow.

At him she stares all the way:

‘What’s happened?’- `Nothing’… - Gets away.

XX

At home he took out pistols To check them up, then put them back

Into the box; he now bristles; Undressed, he took some Shiller’s work.

To read... but thoughts yet make him wonder His heart is sad but doesn’t slumber,

With unaccountable charms He sees his Olga in his arms...

Vladimir has the book to close; He takes a pen: his verse has got

A lot of pretty loving rot; He it declaims; the sound flows

Away in lirical a heat, He cites like Delvig, drunk at feast.

XXI

By chance his verse yet anyhow Is kept by me; you read this rhyme;

‘Where are, where are withdrawn you now The golden days of life my prime?

What does next day for me prepare?

In vain I try to be aware,

The depth of mist can it conceal, Of fate right law will it reveal

But shall I fall by shaft through pierced Or will it pass beside, will slip?

All’s good: for vigil and for sleep Will come the hour well geared;

Are blessed the troubles of the day, Is blessed the darkness of the gravel

XXII

By rays of day will shine the morning And brightly will be playing clay,

But I, it may be, not adoring Will see the secrets of the grave,

The memory of bard, yet youthful, Will sink into oblivion truthful,

The world will me forget, but you My charming girl, will ever you

Some tears shed at urn my early: ‘He tell in love with me,’ to thinks

To me alone could he bring His dawn of life, such sad and stormy!’

My hearty friend, my friend beloved, You come, I’m husband yours by love!"

XXIII

His verse is sluggish and obscure (It’s called romanticism by us;

To see it here even poor I cannot; does it bother us?)

At last before the dawn of morning His tired head on table’s falling

At the ideal, fashioned word, A stilly dream my Lensky had.

But as soon as in charms of dreaming He lost himself - his neighbour comes

To silent room of bard, alarms And wakens Lensky by appealing:

‘It’s seven soon, it’s time to wake, Onegin, may be, has to wait’.

He was mistaken: sleeping fair — Onegin then for world was dead,

The shades of night are now rare And Vesper’s met by cock ahead.

Onegin is deep sleep just having; The sun is now high in heaven,

And flitting quickly snow-storm Is shining, whirling. But at all

From bed Onegin wasn’t moving, The dream yet flies about him.

At last he fast awakes from dream, Apart the flaps of curtain’s moving

He looks and sees: the time is high Away from yard for mill to fly.

XXV

He hurries up to ring.

His servant Guillot from France, is running in,

He offers necessary service And dressing-gown puts on him.

Onegin’s quick to dress. Already His sernant’s ordered to be ready

Together go and with him To take the box with fighting thing.

The sledge for race is now ready, In it he’s flying to the mill;

Has come; to servant says he will Lepage’s fatal barrels steady

With him be keeping, and the sledge To park in field not far from hedge.

XXVI

My Lensky on the dam is leaning, For them impatiently he waits.

With mill Zaretsky has been dealing: Mill-stones he investigates.

Onegin’s coining with excuses.

Zaretsky to behave refuses: ‘But where is the second yours?’

In duels classic, pedant cross

He loved the method with his passion: To make a man on earth to lay

He didn’t want by any way But by the rules of artful fashion,

As legends say of old age (For that we’d praise in him the sage).

XXVII

’My second? - Eugene said with passion, My friend, monsieur Guiilot, does wait.

I can’t foresee any objection To this representation made.

Its true, he is unknown version, But really he's honest person!’

Zaretsky’s bitten both lips; To Lensky Eugene then appeals:

‘Shall we begin?’ ‘Perhaps,’ says Lensky.

And quickly both they yet off

Behind the mill.

Meanwhile far off The honest person and Zaretsky

Grand treaty’s ditties exercise; The foes stand and drop the eyes.

XXVIII

The foes!

Shortly each from other Were drifted they by thirst of blood.

Not long ago they like brothers Divided meals, ideas, flood

Of daily troubles.

Now spiteful, Like in vendetta they are frightful,

Like in a dreadful misty dream Against each other in the still

Prepare ruins once for ever...

They’d better laugh before they had

With blood sustained each pure hand... They’d bel.ter part in friendly manner...

The enmity’s afraid in world Of eyes derisive, scornful word!

XXIX

The pistols all are now shining, The hammer’s jingling at the lock,

To barrels go bullets hiding; First time is clicking pistol’s cock.

The powder, by grey parts handed, On shelf is falling; an indented,

Reliably well screwed the flint Is cocked once more.

And stands at stint

Behind a stump Guillot quite scared.

The foes put the capes on steppe.

Zaretsky thirty second step Has measured with exactness cared

Then took the friends for last his track Arid each of them the pistol had.

XXX

‘You now meet...’ - And both coolly, The enemies, not aiming yet,

In slow gait, quite fast and smoothly Have come the fourth already step.

Four fatal for the life the stages...

His pistol then Onegin raises

Not stopping coming in advance, The first of them to catch a chance.

And more five steps they neared striding, And Lensky screwed left eye more fast,

Began to aim... but quickly just Onegin shot...

The clock’s been striking

The fixing time; the poor bard In silence drops his pistol hard

XXXI

On chest he puts his hand, unfortunate, And falls.

His misty, foggy gaze

Expresses death but not the torture.

From mountains descends this way

In sunny rays all sparkling, shining A block of snow hardly sliding.

By instant cool is all filled up To him Onegin hurries up,

He looks, he calls him - all’s for nothing!

He isn’t more… The youngling bard

Has found end untimely hard!

The storm has breathed; his prime such charming

Has withered at the morning dawn., The fire at the altar’s gone.

XXXII

Unmovingly he lay, and queer Was heavy brow’s languid peace.

He under chest was wounded here, The blood yet steaming flew at ease.

A trice ago was he living And his young heart was full of feeling,

Of hope, enmity and love, The blood was boiling, life could laugh.

But like a house all deserted It’s dark and still, and not by chance

It’s mute for ever all at once.

Are shut the shutters, limed are flirted The windows.

The master’s gone God knows where, Tracks are wrong.

XXXIII

It’s nice by epigram audacious To make erroneous foe mad,

It’s nice to see when stubborn gracious He bends his horns to butt is apt,

Unwittingly in mirror’s peeping Ashamed to recognize: he’s beaten;

Its nicer, friends, much more when he Is wailing foolishly: its me!

And much the more it’s nice in silence For him prepare honest grave,

To aim unseen at forehead pale, At distance try to make him silent.

But yet to make him be at rest Of pleasures won’t be the best.

XXXIV

What would you feel if by your pistol Were killed a friend such good and young

Who was unmodest, who by bristle. An answer, other trifles done,

Offended you at bottle badly, Or if yet he, annoyed, quite madly

To challenge you could try like hell? But in your soul can you tell

What would you feel if still, unmoving Your friend on earth is mute at rest

In front of you with signs of death Is stiffening slowly, is cooling,

Is being deaf and dumb at all To sad and desperate your call?

XXXY

In languish of the heart remorses He pressed his pistol in his hand,

At Lensky Eugene looks quite forceless.

‘Well, he is killed’,- the neighbour said.

He’s killed!..

By dreadful exclamation Onegin’s shuddered; slain, impatient

To call some people gets away.

Zaretsky cautiously could lay

On sledge the corpse, all icy, lone, He’s taking home dreadful hoard,

And smelling dead the horses snort And struggle; they with white wet loam

Are wetting iron hard curb-bit, Like shaft they gallop with all speed.

XXXVI

My friends, on bard you’d have a pity: Of hopes rain-bowed at prime

For world has done yet nothing titling, To grow male yet hadn’t time

But withered!

Where’s agitation And honourable aspiration

Of youthful passion and of thought, Exalted, tender, bold, prompt?

Where are of stormy love his itchings, The thirst for knowledge and for work,

The fright of shame, of evil word? Where are you, cherished happy dreamings,

The ghosts of unearthly whims, Of sacred poetry dreams?

XXXVII

He, might be, for the world’s welfare Or even for the fame was born;

His lyre, now mute, could dare Alarm a loud peal for long,

For centures to make him known.

On steps of world the bard might go

Upstairs to the highest rate.

But his such sufferable shade,

It may be, with itself has carried Some sacred secret; evil choice

Has mined great life-giving voice, And after funeral sad habit

He’ll never hear hymn of times, The blessing of the future tribes.

XXXVIII, XXX1X

It might he other: he’d he having Some common, plainful, simple lot:

The youthful years would be fading, The soul’s heat would not be hot

In many trends he’d change his habit: Would part with muses, would be married,

In village cuckold but good, In wadded overall with hood

He would have known life quite real, At fourty gout would have had,

Would bore, eat, drink, be ill, he fat, At last in own bed ideal

Among the children would he die At hands of doctors, weepers, wife.

XL

But anyhow, dear reader, Alas! it was young lover’s lot:

The poet, the thoughtful dreamer Was killed by hand of friend for nought!

There is a place not tar from house In which inspired bard could rouse.

Two pines accreted by one root, Beneath are streaming snakes of brook

Which came from neighbouring a valley; The peasants come to take a rest,

The reapers dip the jars for best Arid pleasant clear water daily.

And at the brook in thickened shade Is put a monument just made.

XLI

And near it (when it is raining In spring on corns of near fields),

A shepherd bast gay sandal’s making, Of fishers from the Volga sings.

And young a woman, city dweller All summer in the country spender

Can daily headlong ride full speed; When she alone in the field

At brook the monument is seeing She’s drawing made of leather rein,

The veil on hat she turns away, And superficially is reading

A plain inscription, then she tries To stop the dim in tender eyes.

XLII

And slowly through fields she’s riding, Immersed is deeply in the dream:

For long by fate of Lensky, striking, Unwittingly her soul’s filled

She thinks:

‘Whith Olga what could happen?

Or not for long her heart was shattered

And passed away of tears time?

And where is her sister line?

And fugitive of world and people, For stylish beauties stylish man,

Where is that sullen gloomy crank, The killer of the bard such feeble?’

Meantime account, made for you, In details I shall give to you,

XLIII

But now, heartily I though Do love my hero fine,

Of course, of him I’ll quickly know,- For him I now haven’t time.

My age inclines for strict a prose, Against light rhymes my age arose

And I - with sighing I confess - Am dangling after her much less.

My pen has no old wishes To spoil some useful flying leafs;

Some other, cool and cold dreams. Some other, more severe issues

In noise of world and in the still Disturb my soul’s quiet dream.

XLIV

I’ve heard some voice of new desire, I’ve got new sorrow anew;

By new one can’t I be admired I pity old one - it’s true.

You, dreams, my dreams, where is your pleasure And rhyme to it: my youth, my treasure ?

Can it be real that at last My youth had withered in the past?

Can it he real anyhow Without elegical deed

That spring of youth could quickly speed (As I could joke until now)?

And is it true, it can’t return?

And am I soon at thirties turn?

XLV

It means: my noon has come, its needed For me to realize, I see.

O’key, but let us part not frigid. Ah, youth my light! Ah, dear me!

I’m greatful for the good enjoyments, For sadness, for the pretty torments,

For noise, for storms, for many feasts, For everything! For all your gifts

To you I’m greatful!

You alone Among anxieties in still

Could me enjoy... I’ve had my fill; It is enough!

With clear soul

New way I’m starting, do my best From all past life to take a rest.

XLVI

Let me look back.

Forgive me thickets In which my days have passed away,

Were lilted with passions, lazy fidgets, With dreams of thoughtful soul’s haze.

And you, my youthful inspiration, Disturb my weak imagination,

You make my sleepy heart revive, To my good nook more often dive.

You don’t let be cooled my soul, Become embittered, hardened, dry,

At last like dead to petrify In deadly thrill of world on whole;

In this a dirty pool with you, My friends, I have a bath like you.

CHAPTER SEVEN

You are, my Moscow, beloved of Russia daughter, and where can we find some other of the kind..

Dmitriyev.

How would you not love Moscow?

Baratynsky.

The drive to Moscow! It means the world to see!

Where is it better?

Where we have never been.

Griboyedov

I

By vernal rays all driven now From hills the snows, turned to mud,

By turbid brooks have run all down To meadows, all under flood.

By clear smile the nature’s fitting Through dream the year’s morning meeting

The shining skies are now blued.

Yet limpid is the near wood

As if by greenish down covered.

A bee to fields, of tribute well,

Is flying from the waxy cell.

Are drying valleys many-coloured;

The herds make noise; of nightingale The song at silent night is gay.

II

Quite sad for me is your occurence, The spring, the spring! of love the time!

What languid agitation current There is in blood and soul mine!

With hard emotion yet tender I am enjoyed by breath such gentle

Of puffing to my face the spring In bosom of the country’s still!

Or am I stranger to enjoyments, To all that gladdens and revives,

Triumphant is and gladly shines, Is boring me, makes suffer torments

My soul, long ago dead, And all for it seems dark ahead?

III

Or aren’t we glad to see returning Of perished in the autumn leaves

Because remember bitter mourning When hear noise of forest’s thicks?

Or with the nature just reviving We close in, confused by minding

The withering of own days, Which can’t revive by any ways?

May be, the thought to us is coming Amid poetical a dream

Of other, old, better spring, And all the heart it is alarming

By dreams of distant pretty side, About moon and charming night...

IV

Is time: all good but lazy-bone Epicurean wise all men,

You all indifferent, lucky, prone Of Levshin school the pupils, fans,

You, country Priams, should be ready; And you, each sensitive a lady:

The spring to country all you calls, The time of work, of fruits, of warmth,

The time for strolles, much inspired, And all seductive, tempting nights.

Be quick, my friends! the field invites. In carts with weights of food, attires,

By own or by post-chase You get away from city gates.

V

And you, my reader dear, gracious, In your borouch from other land

You leave your city big, audacious, In which the winter’s mirth you’d had.

With dear muse of mine capricious Let’s hear forest’s noise delicious

At nameless river, small and fine. In village where Eugene mine,

That hermit idle and despondent Yet recently in winter lived

Not far from Tanya, young and grieved, My dear dreamer quite respondent;

But where now he is not... And where left he dismal rot.

VI

Among the hills in semicircle Well go there where brook

Through grass is snaking, green and purple, Through linden trees for river’s crook.

The nightingales, of spring the lovers, At night all sing: dog-rose flowers;

You hear voice of little source, You see grave-stone small and coarce

In shade of two pine-trees quite old; Inscription can to you explain:

‘Vladimir Lensky here’s lain, He met his death like man quite hold

At such a year, such an age.

You lie, young hard, in peace all age!’

VII

On branches of the pine permissive Sometimes an early morning wind

Above this urn, to fate submissive, A wreath mysterious could swing.

It happened: late at time of leisures Two girl-friends, both yet teen-agers

Were in the dimmish light of moon Embraced, were weeping at the tomb.

But now...

Tomb-stone is gloomy, Is lost, and last of feet the prints

Decayed...

The branch has no wreath; Beneath, alone, grey and puny,

The shepherd’s singing as before And makes bast sandal more and more.

VIII, IX, X

My poor Lensky! badly pining Not very long was weeping she.

Alas! young bride, if she were trying, To sadness loyal couldn’t be.

Some other now drew attention, Some other managed with invention

By love her grief to lull to sleep, Some uhlan could her flattered keep;

That uhlan’s loved by all her soul… At altar now does she stand

With wreath, ashamed, his hand in hand, With drooping head, as if yet lone,

With fire in the drooping eyes, Unwittingly she slightly smiles.

XI

Behind the grave my Lensky poor To deaf eternity was used.

Was he, the youth, a singer gloomy By fatal treachery confused?

Or sleeping over the Lethe The poet is quiet, easy,

Him nothing there can alarm, The world for him is shut dud dumb?

Yes! just indifferent oblivion Behind the grave for all us waits.

Of loos, friends and lover-maids The voice is fading.

All yet living

The heirs of estate, all cross, Obscenely disputes try to force.

XII

The ringing voice of Olga, though, From Larin’s soon forever went:

That uhlan, slave of lot his own, With her should come to regiment.

And sadly shedding hitter tears To part with Olga mother nears

And seems to be yet hardly live: But Tanya simply couldn’t cry,

She deathly pale was looking round And all her face was greatly sad

When to the porch to part all went. At parting all they fussed about

Around carriage of the young; To see them off Tatyana flung.

XIII

For long as if through fog she one Could follow them all with eyes...

And now Tanya is alone Alas! for long-time friend she sighs,

Her young and dear, pretty, charming, Her confidante, her near darling

Is brought a long way off by fate, They must for ever separate.

Like shade she aimlessly is hiking And comes into deserted park...

And everywhere finds some mark... But none relief she is yet finding

For tears her, by will suppressed - Her heart is torn in half at breast,

XIV

And in the solitude severe Her passion’s heating yet much more,

And of Onegin, far from here, Her heart reminds much more to her.

For him she never will he waiting; In him she always must be hating

The killer of his brother-bard; The bard is dead... and that is hard,

But he’s forgotten, and to other His bride has given all herself...

Of bard the memory itself Like smoke at blue sky is rather...

For him two hearts, I can believe, Yet are in grief...

What for to grieve?

XV

The evening sky’s more dark.

The waters Are still.

Some noise by beetle’s raised.

Some round dance away disperses: Behind the river smoked, blazed

The fisher’s fire.

Field is clear In moonlight all it seems like silver.

In own dreams all’s being lost For long Tatyana goes forth.

She went and went.., All of a sudden Sees manor-house from a hill,

Some grove, hamlet under hill, Behind the river sees a garden;

She looks, and all her own heart More often’s heating and more hard.

XVI

The doubts all confused her soul:

‘Shall go forth or should return?..

He isn’t here...

I’m unknown...

I’ll take a look and then turn’,

She now from the hill comes down, And hardly breathing looks around

Bewildered and astonished hard...

She enters a deserted yard.

All barking, dogs to her are running.

At her much frightened loud cries

Of yard boys family just flies.

Ran up and not without fighting

The boys got dogs behind the fence And took the maiden for defence.

XYII

May I just see the banns home? Them Tanya asked.

As quick as can

To call Anisya children go, To take the keys from porch they ran;

At once Anisya then appeared; Through porch the way was quickly cleared

And she to empty house went In which had lived the novel’s crank.

She sees a hall forgotten now, A cue on billiard has a rest,

At crumpled canopy lies next A riding switch.

And with a bow

The woman says:

‘At fire-place Alone barin sat for days.

XVIII

In winter here they had dinner With Lensky, neighbour late, as rule...

You now come to rooms, the inner...

And here is the banns room.

He slept and coffee had he here, His menager’s reports could hear,

A book at mornings here read...

And old barin room this had;

In it, sometimes, on rare sundays At window, in glasses, he

To play the cards was used with me.

Let give the God his soul chances

To rescue, to his hones - peace In grave, in mother-soil at ease!’

XIX

Tatyana with her eyes amazing A look at everything can take,

And all to her it seems quite wealthy, Revives her languid soul’s rate

By this half-tormenting a ramble, By table with a faded candle,

At window by books in heap, By bed with carpet, chairs, whip,

By sight through panes at moonlight diminish, By this quite pallid feeble light,

By lordly Byron portrait bright, By doll cast-iron and diminished

With gloomy brow under hat, Who arms cross-folded has had.

XX

For long Tatyana here goes At stylish fascinating cell.

It’s late.

Some cold wind just blows.

It’s dark in valleys.

Rather well The grove sleeps.

At foggy rivers And hills the moon just dasappears.

The pilgrim young, you know why, Should long ago home fly.

And Tanya hides her agitation, But yet she’s sighing once again

And then departures for the way, But asks before for invitation

To conic again to have a look And there lone read some book.

XXI

She parts with woman, house keeping, Behind the gates.

And in a day

At early morning comes for meeting With lone canopy again.

For silent room alone getting At once the whole world forgetting With nobody nearby

For long is weeping she this time.

But then with books she could be dealing.

At first of them she didn’t think, But their choice seemed queer thing, And she was lost in their reading,

With thirst of soul all them held; And she discovered other world.

XXII

And though Eugene, as we know, For long from reading turned his face,

But several books of common row Himself excluded from disgrace:

Of Giaour, Juan famous singer, With him some more two-three might linger:

In them reflects the whole age And modem man of nowadays

Is pictured rather well correctly With his immoral soul wry,

Quite egoistic, selfish, dry, To dreaming dedicated greatly

With his malicious evil wit, Who boils in action for a bit.

XXIII

And many pages yet are keeping Some sharpened markings by the nail;

On them attentive eyes are fixing By will and passion of the maid.

Tatyana’s now trembling, seeing By what a thought, a note, feeling

Sometimes Onegin was surprised, With what could mutely coincide;

At margins of the books she’s meeting Of reader’s pencil slightest signs:

Onegin’s soul always tries Unwittingly to show feeling

With short a word or with a cross, With question sign and so forth.

XXIV

And by degrees but is beginning Tatyana him to comprehend -

Thank God, more clearly - she’s feeling The man, for whom to sigh she had

Through all her fate, severe, ruling. This crank, this dangerous and a gloomy

Creation of the hell or sky, This angel, haughty devil wry,

What’s he? is real imitation From Moscow a spook or whim

In Harold cloak, hat with brim, Or other whims interpretation?

Of stylish words some ready set?

Is he a parody not yet?

XXV

Is really the secret’s found?

Or really she guessed not wrong?

The time is fast, she must be out: For her are waiting so long

Two neighbours, home have been walking And all about her are talking.

‘You see, Tatyana’s not a child,’ The old woman’s voice is mild,-

‘Of them my Olga is the younger.

To fix her fate it’s time, I see;

What shall I do, I can’t foresee; The same she says to all but sharper:

‘Do not.’

Her grief she never hides And lone in the woods she hikes."

XXVI

’But may be she’s in love?’ ‘Who knows?

Buyánov courted: was refused.

To Petushkóv she never goes; Pykhtín, the hussar, toed to fuse

Quite greatly, when he made a visit, On her was fawning, you should see it!

I thought that time: will do, perhaps; But what d’you think? again collapse!’

‘Well, dear me, what is the matter?

For fair of the brides her bring,

To Moscow, they need good things.’..,

‘Ah, father my! the profit’s worsened..’.

‘For single winter it will do, At least I’ll credit money you’…

XXVII

The old woman was admired By that advice, such simple, good;

She courted… at once decided: To Moscow by winter route!

This news Tatyana quickly hears.

To judgings by the world severe

To bring her features clear, plain, Simplicity of country maid

And her attires, such belating, And her belating tune of speech!

Of city dandies, maidens rich To catch the eyes derisive, rating

Such dread! She wants to be away, In thickets of the woods to stay.

XXVIII

She’s getting up with rays of morning, At once she hurries to the fields

And with her eyes all them adoring She looks around and she speaks:

‘Forgive me, ever peaceful valleys, Hill peaks well known under heavens,

And you, well known dear wood, And charming skies of neighbourhood.

Forgive me you, my dear nature; I change my world such still and light

For noise of fuss such brilliant, bright.

And you forgive, my freedom later!

For what and where do I strive?

And what can give me fate of mine?’

XXIX

Much longer now she is hiking, But now brook and now hill

Induce to have a stop, inviting In front of their charms to kneel.

And like with friends, for long well known, With all the meadows and groves

She hurries up to have a chat.

But summer’s flying quicker yet.

The autumn golden is coming, The nature’s now trembling, pale

Like victim under charming veil.

And now North, all clouds driving,

Has breathed, has wailed; from nothern shelf Enchanting winter comes herself.

XXX

It came, it scattered, it is hanging On boughs of the oak-trees;

It lies like carpets, white and waving, Among the fields, around hills.

The banks of stopped, unmoving river By shroud are equated here.

The frost is sparkling, we are glad To everyone of winter prank.

But Tanya’s heart yet isn’t gladdened, To meet the winter never came,

The frosty dust did not inhale, With early snow, as it happened,

Can’t wash her arms, her breast and face: Afraid she is of winter ways.

XXXI

Departuring date again's belated And can yet run the last of dates.

Upholsterers inspected, painted Renewed the old closed sleighs.

Of three kibitkas transport own Can bring belongings of the home:

The chairs, saucepans and the trunks, The matresses and jams in jars,

The feather beds, the cocks in cages, The basins, pots, et cetera,

Well, many trifles like the bra.

Among the servants-maids-teenagers.

Arose noise at parting grades: They bring from stables eighteen jades.

XXXII

They harness them in sleighs for road. The breakfast’s ready in the room.

They all kibitkas brim-full load. All men and women raise a boom.

On jade postillion’s sitting ragged, Emaciated, beard’s shaggy.

All servants gathered at the gate To part with barins.

Boom could fade.

They sat. The aging sleigh is sliding, Is stilly crawling through the gate.

‘Forgive, my place, my peaceful mate!

Forgive, secluded my asylum!

But shall I see you?’ - Tanya cries And sheds the tears from her eyes.

XXXIII

When we for better education Will widen more all needed frames

(In times, by thorough foundation Of philosophical best rates,

Five hundred years), roads, may be, In all the state will change invently:

The highways Russia will unite, Connect and cross its any side;

Cast-iron bridges over waters Will go like a bow wide;

At any sides we’ll hills divide, Will dig the tunnels under waters;

And christened world will have the will To build per station own inn.

XXXIV

We haven’t any decent road, Forgotten bridges all decay.

The bugs and fleas at stations lone Each minute take your sleep away.

The inns are absent.

Rooms are cold, In them some hungry but high-flown

A menu hangs for order’s sake And teases appetite in vain.

Meanwhile the Cyclops of the village In front of dimmish forge’s light

With Russian hammer and the might Return to sleighs the foreign image;

They bless the harmful ruts of land And ditches of the fatherland.

XXXV

But at the time of cold winter The drive is pleasant all the day:

Like senseless rhymes of stylish In winter’s even every way.

Automedones all are dashing Untiring are troikas flashing.

Amusing idle gaze, all miles Are glimpsing like a fence in eyes.

Unlucky Larina was going (To waste the money was afraid)

Not by the post-chaise, by jade, And my Tatyana was enjoying

Enough the boredom on the ways: The journey took them seven days.

XXXVI

In front of them when they were near White-stone Moscow they saw:

Like heat are shining crosses dear; They guilded cupolas adore.

Ah, brethren! pleased I was then greatly When many curches, each with belfry,

The gardens, chambers before me I could at once all gathered see!

Each day in grief of separation By fickle fate, too far from you

You, Moscow, I thought of you!

My Moscow... in this lunation

For Russian heart too much is fused And echoed in it through muse!

XXXVII

They see encircled by its grove Petrovsky castle.

It in strain

With pride for recent fame can glow: Napoleon waited but in vain

(Still previous happiness was feeling) To see my Moscow just kneeling

Of old Kremlin keys to give; But didn’t come at all to him

My Moscow with guilty feeling; Yet neither feast and nor a gift

She had in hand: by fire heat That hero she was meeting.

From here, deeply lost in thought, He looked at threatening flame he got.

XXXVIII

Good-bye, the witness of past glory, Petrovsky castle.

Go on!

Of turnpike pillars white and florid Are seen... Tverskaya gets along...

Across the pits the sleigh is speeding, Is passing by the stalls, the women,

The lanterns, children, many shops, A palace, gardens, cloisters, flocks

Of Buchars, sledges, kitchen-gardens, The merchants, peasants arid the huts,

The boulevards, cossacks and the butts, Drug-stores and towers, the garments,

The balconies; with lions gate, While on the crosses jackdaws reign.

XXXIX, XL

To tiresome this drive, all failing, An hour or two they gave;

At Kharitónya’s in the alley In front of house at the gate

The sleigh has stopped; to auntie old, Consumptive now, to behold

Her own house they have come; The door wide open was done

By greyish Kalmyk: wears glasses And torn a coat, socks in hands;

At inner room a cry just bangs: Princess is ill in bed, but fusses.

In tears women have embraced And exclamations have been raised.

XLI

- Princess, mon ange! -

‘Pachette!’- Alina!

‘Who might be thinking... all the time!

For how long?

My cousin dear, Sit down... complex is the life!

My God, a scene from novels dear...’ -And that’s my daughter...

Tanya, near!

‘Ah, Tanya!

Dear! come to rue… As in a dream it seems to be...

D’you, Grandison in mind yet keeping?’

What Grandison? Ah, Grandison!

Well, I remember... has he gone?

At Simeon’s he’s now Living. He saw me at Twelfth-night sometime, His son was married then meanwhile.

XLII

And that... but afterwards you’ll know, Is not it true?

With kin to meet

To-morrow we’ll Tanya show...

But I can hardly drag my feet,

To be with you I cannot go...

But you are tortured by the road.

Let’s come together... take a rest...

I haven’t force... is tired breast…

For me is now hard the gladness, Not only the grief... my heart...

For nowhere am I smart...

With age the life is such a badness...’

And here she, exhausted, sad In tears bad a cough has had.

XLIII

Of ill princess the joy, caresses Are touching Tanya, but she feels

Quite badly at unknown places, Accustomed to her chamber, fields.

And under curtain fine, all silky, In her new bed she is unsleepy,

And early ringing of the bells (Precursor of the morning works)

Nor makes get up without choosing.

At window she now sits.

The more to light the darkness fits. In vain for fields she’s now looking:

Instead she sees unknown yard, The fence, the kitchen, mews, a cart.

XLIV

To all of kin the dinners row They take my Tanya every day

To each grandparent to show Her lazyness dispersed for days.

The kin from distant places rare Have tender welcome everywhere,

And exclamations at the board:

‘What big is Tanya!

Is it not

That recently I was you christening?’

I was taking you in hands!

‘And I your ears pulled by hands!’

‘And I was gingebread you giving!’

And all grandparents exclaim: ’But how years fly away!’

XLV

In them you can’t see any changes, They keep in patterns old gap:

Princess Helena has for ages The same of tulle well made night cap,

Is whitening on Lukérya Lvovna, The same yet lies Lytibóv Petróvna.

Iván Petróvich’s fool and bore, Semyón Petróvich stints yet more;

With Pelagéya Nikolávna The same’s monsieur, her Fine-Mouche, friend,

The same is dog, the same’s her man Which is of club the loyal number,

Still humble, deaf like long before, Still eats and drinks for two or more.

XLVI

My Tanya’s hugged by their daughters.

Of Moscow young graces good

At first are silent her observers, They look at her from head to foot;

They all can find her somewhat queer Provincial and affected creature

But somewhat pale and rather thin, And yet she’s looking rather slim;

Submissive to the natural passion Invite to them, become her friends,

Are kissing, tenderly press hands, They flop her curls up to the fashion,

And all entrust in singing voice The secrets of the maiden’s choice,

XLVII

Of others victories and own The pranks, the hopes and the dreams.

All innocent the talkings flow; With lie they beautify some things,

Then for the babbles due concession To hear of her heart confession

In tender manner they agree.

But Tanya now like in dream

To their talks pays none attention, In them she sees yet nothing smart,

And secrets of her own heart, Her sacred tears, happy tension

Quite mutely for herself she keeps, Of them to nobody speaks.

XLVIII

Tatyana tries to listen better To interests of the common clash;

But in the parlour all are flattered By such a trifle, banal trash;

In talks all’s plain, its all indifferent, Yet slander they without interest;

In fruitless speeches drily fuse inquiries, some gossips, news,

But none a thought for days is flashing; At neither random nor by chance

The languid wit forever smiles; The heart is still, its never dashing,

And even nonsense having joys This idle world each time avoids.

XLIX

From archives coining several youngsters In throng at Tanya stiffly gaze,

By thoughts of her each one another Unfavourably try to daze;

Of them some queer clown dismal Her found almost ideal

And leaning mutely on the door Is writing elegies for her,

At boring aunt’s my Tanya meeting Once Vyasemisky in his good age

Her soul managed to engage; And near him Tatyana seeing

His wig yet smoothing by his hand Of her inquires old man.

L

But where of Melpomen heavy Resounds fine and drawling wail,

While she’s by tinsel gown waving In front of her some throng to hail;

Or where Thalia’s stilly dreaming To friendly claps yet isn’t listening;

Or where Terpsichore one Amazes all the public young

(As well as in the old years In time of mine and time of yours),-

They nowhere turned to her Lornettes of jealous ladies dear

Nor tubes of stylish expert-men From stalls and boxes ever then.

LI

They bring Tatyana to grand meeting The tightness, agitation, heat,

Of music roar, of candles gleaming, The flash, the whirl of couples quick,

Of beauties light and fine attires, Of people variegated choirs,

And semicircle wide of brides,- All that at once one’s feelings strikes.

Enrolled dandies show here The impudence and fine gillette

And unattentive smart lornette.

On leave the gussars hasten here

Themselves to show making booms, To gleam, to charm, to fly to troops.

LII

The night has many stars, all charming; The brightest one at heaven’s blue

Among the friends the moon’s more shining; To Moscow all beauties flew.

But She whom I yet don’t dare To trouble with my lyre fair,

She like the moon to shine has come Among the wives and maids the one.

With heavenly her pride she’s touching The earth when conies to take a rest:

Of what a languor’s full her breast?

What languid is her gaze guile charming:

But that will do; adieu is [node: For madness tribute you have paid.

LIII

The noise, the laughter, running, bows, Mazurka, gallop, waltz.

Meanwhile

Between two aunts at column now, Not seen by anyone that tame,

Tatyana looks but isn't. soon To this world’s fuss she’s hatred feeling.

She’s stuffy here... In her dreams Transfers for life among the fields,

To country, people in the groves, To isolated dear nook

In which yet streams the clear brook, To flowers, to all the novels,

Of linden alleys dimmish To places where he then came.

LIV

Her thought is hiking everywhere, Forgotten are the bail, the world.

Meanwhile his eyes off her can’t tear Some general important, grand.

The aunts are winking one to other And pushed my Tanya quickly rather,

And whispered her each one of them: ‘You look left side at those men…’

‘Left side?.. but where? what is there?’ I ‘It doesn’t matter, but you look,

D’you see, in front of that small group The two, the uniforms they wear...

He stepped away... he turned a bit..’-

‘But who? plump general that big?’

LV

Congratulating Tanya dear With first success at fair ring

Let’s turn the route we now here To keep in mind of whom I sing...

Of that two words I must be speaking: Of young my friend I’m now singing,

Of multiplied his own crank.

You now bless long years’ work

My muse in ethics well embodied!

To me true compass now lend

Haphazard wander to prevent.

Enough... and has been done the burden:

Well, I saluted classicism! It’s late, but preface has been seen.

CHAPTER EIGHT

Fare thee well, and if for ever 							Still for ever, fare thee well.

Byron

I

That time, when in lyceum’s gardens I flourished quickly, quite serene,

To read Apuleius I was ardent, But Cicero I didn’t read,

That time in sacramental valleys, At cries of swans, of spring endeavours,

At waters shining in the still, A muse had come to me, it filled

My student’s cell; its sullen tightness At once by rays of hers was lit,

She opened the feasts In it And praised devices of the chillness,

And glory of the old starts, And panting dreams of all young hearts

II

The world with smile my muse was electing, The first success lent wings for us,

Derzhavin old us was greeting, To tomb descending blessed he us.

. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .

III

And as a law for me imputing Of passions tyrany unique,

With throng by passions deeply fusing, I brought my playful muse to fit

For hot discussions of the gentry, The terror of the midnight sentry;

To them, to their senseless feasts She brought her fine and dear gifts,

And like the Beccant could she gamble, With bowl sang she for the guests,

And youth of those vanished days All after her could wildly dangle;

And I was proud among friends Of new she-friend with windy trends.

IV

I lagged behind as their member And ran away...

She’s after me.

And how often muse my tender Delighted silent route for me

By sorcery of story’s secrets!

At rocks of the Caucasian districts

Like young Lenore under noon With me was riding like a loom.

And often at Taurida’s beaches She brought me in the have of night

At sea to hear for a while Of nereid unceasing whispers,

Eternal choir or the waves, To lord of world the hymn of praise.

V

She capital forgot at distance, Its lustre, all its noisy feasts;

Among Moldavian dismal thickets She visited marquees in peace

Nomadic life to better know, Herself with them could wild she go,

And she forgot the speech of gods For scant and queer lots and lots

Of words for songs of prairie districts...

But suddenly was changed it all:

And now in my garden small She came at once as district mistress,

In eyes with dismal thought of brains, Arid with a book in French in hands.

VI

First time indeed my muse just now To worldly rout I can lead;

In all her charms, to steppes yet bound, I can with jealous shyness poop.

Through tight a row of the grandeurs, Of diplomats, of army dandies,

Of proud ladies yet she slips, She now looks, but stilly sits,

Admires all the noisy tightness, The flash of dresses and of words,

Arrival slow of the guests In front of hostess young brightness,

Around ladies dark a frame Of gaping, like at pictures, men.

VII

She likes the order, well-composed, Of oligarchial the chats,

The cool of humble pride composed, Of ages medley and of ranks.

But who is that, in throng selected, Is standing mute and unaffected?

To all he seems to be some strange; In front of him the faces range

Like tiresome a rank of ghosts, In face has loftiness or spleen?

What for yet here has he been?

Who’s he?

Not Eugene he’s at most?

But really?

Yes, It is he...

For long has chance with us to be?

VIII

Is he the same or quiet now?

Or, as before, he plays the crank?

What kind’s he now anyhow?

And what for is can now lurid?

Will be like Melmoth? patriotic? Cosmopolite? or has he got it?

Like Harold, Quaker will he fit? Like hypocrite or other fig?

Or will he be a lad good natured Like you and I, like all the world?

At least he’d my advice have held: Refuse the modes antiquated,

Enough he fooled the whole world? At least he’d my advice have held: Refuse the modes antiquated. Enough he fooled the whole world…

D’you know?...

- Yes and no yet.

IX

- But why you so indisposed Are speaking bad about him?

Because we restlessly disclose Defects; are bustling; judge the whim?

Because uncautious ardent soul Annoys, ridicules, as a whole

Insults all proud paltry males: The wit them presses, needs a space?

Because we often take the talkings For real, useful, vital things?

The folly’s wicked, giddy, needs Grand rubbish for the grand high persons;

But persons ordinary for us Are never strange, they fit all u.0

X

He’s blessed, who in his youth was youthful! He’s blessed, who well in time was ripe.

Who made his life not cooled, but useful, With years could his aims abide;

To queer dreams did not abandon, From mob apart was never standing,

At twenty dandy was with brain, At thirty married was with gain,

At. fifty who was liberated From private and from other debts,

Who glory, money and the ranks In turn and quietly effected,

Of whom they spoke till the end: N.N. is excellent a man.

XI

Its sad to think, indeed, that vainly The youth was given to all us,

We easily betrayed her daily And she was cheating all of us;

That all the best and sacred wishes,	 And all the fresh and pure dreamings

Have been decayed in nature’s train Like leaves in autumn, full of rain.

Unbearable is at rout Of mere dinners see a line

To look at life like at the rite, And follow the decent crowd,

But yet not sharing with throng Ideas, passions yours life long".

XII

As object of the judging noisy, In life you’d never have a wish:

Among the people wise quite choicely To pass for feigned a queer. fish,

Or kind of madcap; sad a version Of some Satanic ugly person,

Or even own demon mine. Onegin (him I’ll occupy),

Who killed at duel friend his own, Had lived without aim, this sage,

To twenty six of own age. Was weary at leisure one

Without service, wife or deed, By something to engage unfit.

XIII

Some kind of trouble was him teasing: For change of places secret cue

(A highly torturing a feeling, A voluntary cross of few).

He left with real consolation Of woods and valleys isolation,

In which a bloody, dreadful shade To him appeared every day.

He aimlessly began to wander, With passions only agrees,

But all his journeys and the trips, Like all in world, began to bother:

And he returned just to the hall Like Chatsky: from the ship for ball.

XIV

The crowd now all is waving, A whisper through the hall has flied...

To hostess a lady’s heading, Some plump grand general’s behind.

Her movements were unhurried, slow. Nor cool, nor talkative is, though

She doesn’t glare at the rest, And doesn’t claim to have success;

At people looks she, never smirking, Without imitating tricks…

She’s still and simple at a glimpse. She seemed to be a certain copy,

Do comme il faut… (Shishkov, forgive; can’t some good translation give).

XV

The ladies tried to her to near; The old women smiled on her;

The men all bowed her more eager And tried to catch the eyes of her.

The maidens tried to pass by quiet In front of tier through hall; and higher

His nose, shoulders could raise The general, by her amazed.

They didn’t use the word a beauty To call her, but from head to foot

In her could never find a hook To use the word on fashion’s duty,

Which they in world of London grant To speak like vulgar, (but I can’t...

XVI

I very much this word am liking, But cannot I this word translate,

In life with us like new it’s hiking, And hardly will it have good fate.

In epigrams it. would be fitting...). But let’s return to lady sitting.

With charms untroubled she is sweet; For long at table does she sit

With brilliant Voronskaya Nina, Of Nova Cleopatra this.

Perhaps, you would agree, that is By marble charms unable Nina

She-neighbour her to outshine, Herself is though dazzling, fine.

XVII

‘Indeed? - my Eugene’s now thinking, - But is it true?..

Exactly...

Not...

Why! out of the country thickets...’

Lornette his captious he has got,

Directs it constantly, each minute At her, who by her own image

Forgotten features can remind.

‘You tell me, prince, if don’t mind,

Who’s there, crimson beret wears, With Spanish diplomat she speaks?’,

The prince as if anew him sees:

‘I see, in world you’ve been too rare...

Well, to present you I shall try’

‘But who is she?’ She is my wife,

XVIII

‘What, you are married! didn’t know!

And how long?’ ‘Two will he fast...’

‘And whom?’ - She’s Larin’s. -

‘Tanya though!’ ‘D’you know her?-

‘I’m neighbour just’.

‘Well, let us go…’ Prince then nears His own wife (and she them hears),

Presents his friend and distant kin.

Princess is staring at him...

Despite her soul, such embarrassed, Despite her passions being raised,

Astonished being and amazed, - As if by nothing she was harassed:

She kept her manners quite the same, Was quiet bow her again.

XIX

Good heavens! Never did she shudder! Nor sudden paleness, redness has...

And no brow moved she rasher; She didn’t even lips her press.

At her to gaze he was assidious, But no tracks of Tanya previous

Could my Onegin now find.

To have a talk with her he tried

And… he could not.

She was him asking: For long he's here? Where from?

If their district visits on?

And then at prince she was adjusting

Her tired look and slipped away...

Unmoving, lone he’s again.

XX

Is she the same Tatyana real? To whom he privately, in haze,

At start of novel good ideal In thicket of a distant place,

In happy heat on moral lecture By chance could give her like preceptor?

The same, from whom he now keeps A letter, where heart her speaks,

And where everything’s at freedom? The same yet girl... or its a dream?

The same yet girl, whom he in whim Neglected then like meek for wisdom?

Indeed she now could behave Indifferently, could be brave?

XXI

He now leaves the noisy rout. He goes home, has to think;

And now sullen, now harmful Ideas trouble late his dream.

Aid he awoke; they are bringing A letter: him prince N. is bidding

For evening party...

‘Lord! to her!..

Yes, I shall come, I’ll come!’ - before

His lunch him answered with politeness.

What happened, what a strange a dreamt

What has been moved inside of him, In soul lazy, cool, delightless?

Annoyance? bustle? or anew Some love - the trouble of the youth?

XXII

Again his time Onegin counts, Again the day is dragging forth;

It’s striking ten; he’s driving out. He’s flying... now he’s at porch.

He trembles... to princess he’s coming; His Tanya lone he is finding_

Together for a time they sit.

Are silent.

Not a word can slip

Away from Eugene’s lips; morose, He’s awkward, hardly has he force

To answer her.

To him occurs A stubborn, rude idea though,

And stubbornly he looks; but she Is sitting quietly, she’s free.

XXIII

Her husband comes.

He is suspending This quite unpleasant tete-a-tete.

And with Onegin’s recollecting Some jokes, pranks of old date,

They laugh; the guests are now coming.

And by the salt of worlds backbiting

Has been enlivened all the talk; In front of hostess light rot

Without mincing style was shining, But interrupted was meanwhile

By prudent talk without trite, E ternal morals, prigs surviving,

And didn’t frighten anyone By natural vividness and fun,

XXIV

The capital’s high pick was there, Of fashion patterns, the elite.

The persons, known everywhere, And wanted fools for trampling feet.

Some old ladies had been seated, All capped, with roses, looked wicked;

They had invited several maids With never smiling, sullen face;

Of State the envoy always spoke About needs, the State had had;

With fragrant, all grey-haired head An old man said old jokes,

All line and clever at his date, A bit ridiculous to-day.

XXV

For epigrams was always greedy With everything quite cross a Dan;

With Lea, that’s given him too sweety; With ladies’ flatness; tunes of men;

With talks about novel hazy; With symbol, making sisters crazy;

With war; with magazine’s white lie; With snow and with own wife,

Forbidding goddess, guile inventive, Of reigning, sumptuous Neva fine.

But people! all you are alike Your ancestor, called Eve, foremother: What’s given, hardly it involves, But constantly the Dragon calls

To him for tree, mysterious rather: Forbidden fruit to have you’d like, Or Eden to itself’s unlike.

XXVIII

But how greatly Tanya’s altered!

Her role how firmly played,

And could of high oppressive order All manners quickly imitate!

And who would look for maiden tender In this majestic casual manner

Of legislator of the halls?

And he inspired her at dawns!

Sometimes of him in midnight hazes, Untill yet Morpheus, she believes,

Would come, she innocently grieves, Her languid eyes to moon she raises;

And dreams, that she with him as wife Will pass the peaceful mute of life!

XXIX

For love all ages are submissive But to the innocent young heart

It is benevolent, releasing, Like vernal storms in fields make start

The first in life the stormy passions, And they give birth to new impressions,

Then life almighty brings the good: A pompous bloom arid costly fruit,

But if the age is late and fruitless At natural turn of life for rack,

Is sad of passions dead a track; This way the storms of autumn coolness

Convert the meadows to pools And bare, leafless make the woods.

XXX

Alas! my Eugene, no doubts, With Tanya is in love like child;

In languish of the loving bounds He’s spending now day and night.

Of sense precautions never heeding, To her glass porch too close speeding,

Arrives he now every day; Her follows like own shade:

He’s happy now just to throw On shoulders her fluffy wrap,

Or, like in fever, can he get A touch of hand, or helps to go

Through thickened crowd of the guests, Or handkerchief picks up with jests.

XXXI

To him she doesn’t pay attention, You strive or die, it is the same:

At home meets without tension, At visits two-three words would say

With more bow can be meeting, Sometimes at all him isn’t seeing;

For flirt she never gives a hint - For that high world is never fit.

To loose his colour he’s beginning: She doesn’t see or she’s too hard!?

Onegin’s pining, feels a smart, He seems to be consumption feeling.

To doctors he is being sent. The doctors him to waters send.

XXXII

He doesn’t go, ready now To write to ancestors: to hail

Before arrival; anyhow She isn’t bothered (that’s female!);

But he is stubborn: to renounce Unfit, yet hopes, hustles; bounce

More brave than sound man, a grand His message wants to send: weak hand

A passionate epistle’s writing.

In letters though he again

Sees no use (and not in vain). But hearty pain to be abiding

Became alredy quite inapt.

His letter’s here, quite exact.

Eugene’s letter to Tatyana

I can foresee: you’ll be abused By sad and secret explanation.

With scornful bitter contemplation Your proud look will me refuse!

But what I’d want? what task am aiming By opening my heart. to you?

To what malicious merry-making, It may be, give a cause for you!

By chance I met you long ago. A spark of tenderness you showed.

I didn’t dare to believe: Cave no start to habits dear,

As I to loose my freedom feared Which’s hateful to my own will.

But something more us separated...

Unlucky victim, Lensky’s gone...

From everything to me legated, I had my heart for ever torn;

By nothing bound, I’m a stranger: I thought: the freedom, peace for me

Replace the fortune.

Goodness me!

What blunder! I’m a punished ranger.

To see you more to have a chance. To follow you everywhere;

The smile of lips, the move of eyes To catch by loving eyes somewhere;

For long to hear, understand Perfections yours, all them confessing

In front of you in pangs to stand, To pale, to fade... That is the blessing?

I’ve been deprived of that; I race, At hazard after you I’m dangling:

I prize my hours, my days: But I’m in idle boredom wasting

By fate all counted my days, All painful are they nowadays,

I see: my age is short: to cure My life for every other day,

From morning forth I must be sure, That I shall see you just to-day.

I dread: in my submissive prayers You’ll see by strict, severe gaze

Some scornful, cunning, idle ventures, - Your angry blame I grasp in haze.

If you could know, what’s diminished To languish in the thirst for love,

In flame by wit to cool each minute The agitation in the blood;

For long to wish, your knees embracing, And weeping at your dear feet,

Entreaties and confessions making, To speak of anything I feel,

Meanwhile with cold sham to dare To force the speech and look with mock

To go on with calm a talk, To fix at you the joyful stare!..

But let it go: at this rate To strive against myself alone

I can’t I am at will your own And I give up to all my fate.

XXXIII

But no answer...

He is seeking New ways. The second day, the third

Without answer.

He for meeting Arrived; is coming... just has got

To meet princess.

But what severe!

He’s not been seen, none word from dear;

Ooh! What encirclement she has Of christening coldness, princess!

To try to keep the indignation Her bps, such stubborn, now want!

Onegin’s fixing eyes upon; Where are compassions, perturbation?

Of tears tracks?..

But none she had!

Her face but has of wrath a track...

XXXIV

And may be tracks of secret fear Of own husband and of world

For pranks or weakness of the dear... (That’s all he knew in own world...)

And no hope!... full of sadness, He now curses own madness.

In it immersed, he there quite The whole world again denied,

And in his own study silent Remembered times, when after him

Severe anguish, called a spleen, Was seeking in the world unquiet,

And took him by the scruff of neck And in a gloomy corner kept.

XXXV

Again promiscuosly he’s reading… Has read all Gibbon and Rousseau,

Manzony, Herder; was re-reading Madame de Stael, Bichat, Tissot,

From Bade that sceptical was reading, With works of Fontanelle was meeting.

Of Russian works he something read, Rejecting nothing for effect;

The almanacs and all the journals In which to us they lectures give,

In which they all are cursing me; Some kinds of madrigals, not oral,

To me I met sometimes in them! E sempre bene, gentlemen! (37)

XXXVI

And what?

His eyes the books were reading, But all his thoughts were far away;

Desires, sorrows, some dreamings In soul crowded each day.

To him among the lines all printed His eyes in spirit always hinted

At other kinds of lines.

To them He paid his all attention then.

They were some secret good traditions Of tender, shady old age:

The dreams, not bound with this day, The threats, the talkings and predictions,

Some lively rots in long a tale Or hearty letters of young maid.

XXXVII

And by degrees to sleep he’s reading His passions, thoughts, his own wit:

In front of him gay fancy’s giving His Pharaoh, and tries to fit;

He sees some smelted snow; now, As if he sleeps in some doss-house,

A youth unmoving lies on it; He hears voices: ‘Well, he’s killed...’

Or can he see forgotten foes, Some cravens, slanderers, a swarm

Of traitresses quite young at all, Of mates despised a circle close;

Or village house - at the pane Is sitting she.., and she again!,.

XXXIII

He so used to live in visions That he could go mad quite free

Or could be poet with reasons (And I confess - could favour me).

Indeed, by magnetism’s all forces The mechanism of Russian verses

To grasp that time he had a chance, But as a student he’s a dunce.

He real bard resented there, When all alone, lost in haze,

In front of flaming fire-place Was Benedetta purring fair

Or Idol mio; dropped by chance On fire journals or his pumps.

XXXIX

The days were speeding; heated air Could mean: the spring is coining fine;

He couldn’t be a bard for ever, He didn’t go mad or die,

The spring enlightened him, and now From dosed chambers he gets out,

In which for winter had a place. Storm windows, the fire-place

At clear morning he is leaving, In sledge along the river flies.

On blue, with slashes covered, ice The sun is gay; the snow’s filthy

In heaps, forgotten in the streets.

But where now through them speeds

XL

My dashing Eugene?

You are guessing To know; you are quite exact:

At Tanya tries to be impressing My unreclaimed yet now crank.

Comes in, of dead has strong resemblance.

None soul’s seen in rooms at entrance...

For her he’s looking on... for nought...

He opened a door."

And what.

Surprises deeply all his reeling?

Princess, undone yet before him

Alone’s sitting, pale and thin, She is some letter now reading,

And sheds of tears stilly stream, Her cheek on hand she has to lean.

XLI

Ah, who would not her silent feelings At this quick moment have read!

And who that poor Tanya previous In this princess could not have met!

In languish of unwitting pities Onegin quickly at her feel is...

She has been shuddered, but is mute, She eyes Onegin as some good,

She’s not astonished, hasn’t anger...

His morbid and quite dying look,

A mute reproach, begging looks, - All that she grasps.

A simple maiden

With dreams and heart of old days In her this time again could raise.

XLII

To get him up she isn’t asking, Not taking eyes off all his head

Does not remove from lips his gasping Her quite insensible small hand...

About what she’s now dreaming?

Too long the silence’s now seeming...

And stilly does she say at last:

‘Enough, get up, I now must

Explain to you, do it frankly.

You must remember that day time,

When in the garden’s alley fine The fate us brought together; sadly

To lesson yours attended I, To-day, you see, the turn is mine.

XLIII

‘Onegin, then I was much younger And, seems to me, much more was fine,

I loved you, I for love had hunger, But what in all your heart could find?

Severity instead of kindness; Indeed, for you was neither tidings

Of humble girl some secret love?

But now - God! - is cooling blood

As soon as I recall your stare And that your homily...

But I

Can’t now blame: that dreadful time To be more honest could you dare;

To me that time you were quite right,’ To you is grateful soul mine...

XLIV

‘But then... or it not true?.. in desert, From fussy rumours being far,

You didn’t like me; What has happened, That after me you now are?

And me you have in view...

What purpose?

Is it because in higher circles

Each other day be seen I must, That I am rich in wealthy caste?

In actions husband’s mutilated, And us for that at court caress?

Or that’s because all my disgrace Would eyes attract to you, belated,

And in the world could help to back Seductive though small respect?

XLV

‘I weep... If that your Tanya old Till now you could not forget,

Your pricks of swear, you must know, Your strict and cool severe chat

(If I had right for some decisions) I would prefer to slighting feelings,

To all these letters, tears, deeds...

That time to all my childish dreams

You had, I saw, some little pity, Some small respect to age, at least...

But nowadays... explain the gist; To feet of mine what is you leading?

And how, with your heart and mind, To he the slave of sense, not kind?

XLVI

‘To me, Onegin, all this splendour, This tinsel of repelling life,

And my in life success at random, My stylish place, the guests till night,

What’s use?

I would with joy allow To give this masquerade by now,

This noise, the lustre and the crooks, For wild a garden, shelves of books,

For that at distance poor dwelling, For place, in which the first toy time,

I saw, Onegin, you in life. For cemetry, eternal setting

In shade of branch some simple cross On grave of dear, poor nurse.

XLVII

‘And happiness was not unlikely, And so near!

But my fate

Decided is.

Incautious, likely, I was, but me could supplicate

My mother in her bitter tears Implored to yield; for Tanya here

All lots that time became alike; And then I married, I would like

To ask you: leave, do not be funny. You know, in your heart I find

Some real honour and the pride.

I love you (why should I be cunning?).

They’ve made me marry other man; And I’ll be true to him till end!

XLVIII

She went away.

My Eugene’s standing As if by thunder has been struck,

To what a storm of sudden sensing At heart he now has to duck!

But jingle of the spurs he hears, Tatyana’s husband just appears,

And thus my hero grin; At minute, difficult for him,

My reader, well he now leaving For long, for ever.

Alter him

Enough in common way with him We wandered in the world.

My greetings!

Hurra! we all have reached the land.

Indeed, for long should have the end!

XLIX

Whatever are you, dear reader, A friend or not, I’d like with you

To part Eke friend, but real, eager.

Forgive!

What for would ever view

You all my slipshod stanzas here: For recollections restless dear;

For quiet leisure after work; For lively pictures, salted word;

For my mistakes in Russian grammar, - Help God to find in all this book

Amusements or for dreams a nook, Some thoughts for heart, for journal’s clamour

A mere hit from all I’d give.

Arid thus we now part, forgive!

L

My travelling mate, I beg your pardon; My true ideal, you forgive!

You, constant vivid job, could harden My slender force, to me could give

All envied by the hard, yet living! In worldly storms - of life oblivion,

Of dear friends a pretty chat.

But many days away could get

Since young Tatyana at some hovel With Eugene, in my hazy dream,

First time appeared at the rim Of outlines of my free novel.

Through magic crystal I could not Myself discern all their lot.

LI

But they, to whom at friendly meeting My first of stanzas could I cite...

Are not, or far away are living, As Sadi said before I write.

Without them Onegm’s pictured.

And she, that young and lovely creature;

Ideal image, Tanya’s rhyme...

Ah, many were by fate denied!

He’s blessed, who feast of life was leaving In time, not drinking to the end

All wine from goblet at his hand Was not till end life’s novel reading,

But suddenly could part from it, As I from my Onegin did,

THE END

Him call to sit to samovar, And Doonya quickly gives him tea,
O Russia!
In Africa; at any step To sigh about mirky Russia,
Less influence on lady’s head; It was, my friends, Martyn Zadeka,
Was brave instead of ‘elle Nina’ To put the ‘belle Tatiana’
Oh, don’t know dreadful dreams You, my young Svetlana
And I, while thinking of Swetlana,
Eugene’s letter to Tatyana
At once was frightened my Tatyana...
‘Pachette!’- Alina!
It was because of cousin dear: In Moscow princess Alina
Perhaps, you would agree, that is By marble charms unable Nina
Is whitening on Lukérya Lvovna, The same yet lies Lytibóv Petróvna.
Well, many trifles like the bra.
Which they are calling spleen in English, In Russian known as khandra.
Etcetera.
The feather beds, the cocks in cages, The basins, pots, et cetera,
By hard from big Tambóv’s engaged; Buyhánov whirls with Pustyakóva,
‘Ah, Tanya!
‘What big is Tanya!
Were in the dimmish light of moon Embraced, were weeping at the tomb.
Him nothing there can alarm, The world for him is shut dud dumb?
But in a while the guests from suburb Are making up a common hubbub:
His geese and ducks tie breeds for fee And teaches children ABC.
To whom your hearts were dedicating,- In written Russian they were bad
And what insidiousness you show, When you amuse a man half dead
He was mistaken: sleeping fair — Onegin then for world was dead,
The shades of night are now rare And Vesper’s met by cock ahead.
My soul, long ago dead, And all for it seems dark ahead?
The chief of rakes, a tribune-tippler. — Hut now simply good the head
One’s horned, with muzzle of a hound; Another has of cock the head;
But wretched is, who’s all foreseeing, Who never felt some ache of head,
To get him up she isn’t asking, Not taking eyes off all his head
In weep my plait was then undid, With songs to altar us could lead.
He ceased to like (with them was led) Invectives, sables and the lead.
First time indeed my muse just now To worldly rout I can lead;
And I confess: from them I fled: It seemed with horror I had read
She liked the books of Richardson Yet no because them all she read.
A book at mornings here read...
Ah, who would not her silent feelings At this quick moment have read!
Her Russian was yet very bad As Russian books she never read.
Let’s read
To read Apuleius I was ardent, But Cicero I didn’t read,
Of State the envoy always spoke About needs, the State had had;
You leave your city big, audacious, In which the winter’s mirth you’d had.
But none she had!
Thank God, more clearly - she’s feeling The man, for whom to sigh she had
Tatyana heard with indignation All those gossips, but she had
He’s puffing, he is remonstrating, He swore to devil Lensky’s head For sufferings, he here had.
He would have known life quite real, At fourty gout would have had,
In Tanya’s, Olga’s rooms all maidens Already happy dreams have had;
Its time for dinner, Guests have had
Let it be so: you have had
Its window is brightly shining, Inside much noise and fuss they’ve had;
Nor Scott, nor Byron, nor Seneka; The Lady’s Fashion Journal had
Then took the friends for last his track Arid each of them the pistol had.
With gloomy brow under hat, Who arms cross-folded has had.
And she has had
Of tyrant you didn’t fear, But now he your fate has had.
And here she, exhausted, sad In tears bad a cough has had.
To have some quick and restless fancy? Because her will and wit has had
And old barin room this had;
They’d better laugh before they had
At the ideal, fashioned word, A stilly dream my Lensky had.
“Uncle is in bed, His breath again began to harden, To see his nephew he’d be glad”.
It’s nice by epigram audacious To make erroneous foe mad,
His wife herself such feeling had: From Richardson to be quite mad.
But you are tortured by the road.
That under gale, en waves in boat All over the sea crossroad
Across a glade, all under snow Around which all’s dark and sad.
Extinguished ash will not be heating, Without tears I am sad
You tell, of them which is Tatyana?’ -That girl, which’s always so sad;
In grief of love Tatyana goes To their garden, she is sad;
And several days she after that Had been entroubled, deeply sad.
She deathly pale was looking round And all her face was greatly sad
That you had come, my dear vision In darkness came for head of bed
Stood Eugene, thoughtful, quite alone, As poet himself described.
Her belt of silk she is removing, Undressed is going to bed,
Tell again, You see, I’m now muddle-headed.
With Ozerov all were delighted, Semyonova with him divided
Some herds were walking in the scene, By garden canopies were ended,
Return him life by jealous flame Or otherwise the male offended,
The great prosperity lo waste - To have at home he intended:
Half-aireal and resplended, To magic bow all attended,
Can it he real anyhow Without elegical deed
Not madrigals my Lensky’s writing In Olga’s album, and indeed
I love you, but with love of brother And may be tenderer indeed.
Of elegy’s bad garland quickly; To all the rhymers, friends indeed,
Forgive me, but my love is deep To Tanya’s dear heart indeed.
Let’s listen, yet without labour, To their talking, short indeed.
Are wetting iron hard curb-bit, Like shaft they gallop with all speed.
The way is short, from dear neighbour They go home fast, at speed;
But suddenly her sister’s coming, Then Lensky comes; the light has flashed;
By lordly Byron portrait bright, By doll cast-iron and diminished
With you I now tears shed;
My muse in ethics well embodied!
At his Penates, quite permissive Vladimir honoured all, who died;
It was the art of tender passion, By Nazon brightly glorified.
Onegin my To sleep at home lone flied.
The crowd now all is waving, A whisper through the hall has flied...
Ah, many were by fate denied!
In it immersed, he there quite The whole world again denied,
In many trends he’d change his habit: Would part with muses, would be married,
Of enemy from pistol parried.
By many signs she’s always worried, In secret way all objects hurried
To have a talk with her he tried
Such custom’s known everywhere: To marry daughters every tried
Some old ladies had been seated, All capped, with roses, looked wicked;
May I just see the banns home? Them Tanya asked.
And all around dreams in still, With light of moon its all fulfilled.
For long by fate of Lensky, striking, Unwittingly her soul’s filled
At waters shining in the still, A muse had come to me, it filled
He’s killed!..
A youth unmoving lies on it; He hears voices: ‘Well, he’s killed...’
(Unhappily, too much all salted). But. with the help of resin bottled,
To be the rest of year free Congratulations are accustomed;
All servant maidens in the yard To guess the fortune were accustomed,
The frosty dust did not inhale, With early snow, as it happened,
‘Ah, father my! the profit’s worsened..’.
She’s wild and sad, is daily silent. Like forest calf, she’s often frightened,
Of praised grandfather’s old age: The Lovelace fame is now rottened
In his first youth he was untrained,
Was victim of the wild misleading Of big his passions unrestrained.
Could catch a neighbour, who by chance Came in - by tragedy at once Him entertained.
He’s blessed, who with his love combined
You see, by skies its predestined:
‘Of whom your own lyre sighs?’ By you I’m often briskly questioned, -
He’s always frowned, taciturn, He’s chilly, jealous, angry turned!
At last it stopped.
But Eugene’s fate for him was fair: At first by Madame he was cared,
Behind a stump Guillot quite scared.
Zaretsky thirty second step Has measured with exactness cared
Like great Chadayev, Eugene dear Of jealousy reproach feared,
All’s good: for vigil and for sleep Will come the hour well geared;
Some string of love in her appeared, In love affairs she was geared
At once Anisya then appeared; Through porch the way was quickly cleared
‘What for you early disappeared?’
It now; but ‘Bordeaux’ prudent To-day to others nave prefered.
And not because the Grandison To Lovelace was by her prefered;
But withered!
By habits of the life he’s pampered, By somebody he was well tempered,
But how greatly Tanya’s altered!
Or not for long her heart was shattered
As if by greenish down covered.
Some merry magpies Tanya sees, All mountains were smoothly covered
Her chest is high, her cheeks are covered By instant flame, they quickly flowered,
He was afraid of being answered
Embarrassment, her being tired Arosed pity, he’s admired;
By whom was tenderness inspired? - With words neglectness who’s admired?
They don’t cost yet neither sense, Nor any songs, by them inspired:
‘And whom your lovely verse adored?’
Are drying valleys many-coloured;
The ashes patriarchal honoured.
Oh, you, the husbands so honoured!
By liars secretly prepared, By worldly mob in chorus favoured,
Without them Onegm’s pictured.
And girls, at banks Salgirian captured.
Of nightly grief I see none track, Your face is blushing poppy-red.-
Despite her soul, such embarrassed, Despite her passions being raised,
In tears women have embraced And exclamations have been raised.
Some noise by beetle’s raised.
At window he flies was killing And daily house-keeper cursed.
My Eugene is in front of home. Hall porter shadfly he bypassed,
Astonished being and amazed, - As if by nothing she was harassed:
He gave his hard; in all her grievance (As they would say, it was unwitnessed)
All fashioned model of the creature Who’s dressed, undressed, anew redressed.
Too long by ballets I was pressed, By Didle too I am depressed».
And gaze attentive of her maidens; She daily greatly is depressed;
He thought she would be much confused, By his arrival much abused;
In single image they confused, In one Onegin all were fused.
Buyánov courted: was refused.
At first his language me confused,
Was he, the youth, a singer gloomy By fatal treachery confused?
Affected native Russian banns, And all the neighbours were amused.
Behind the grave my Lensky poor To deaf eternity was used.
Malvina’s works but separated For several roubles he abated,
But anyway the friend of mine To be light-hearted had been fated,
All given up in summer heat. To count days he simply hated,
Or that’s because all my disgrace Would eyes attract to you, belated,
Sometimes he dares like in game, By smile of Olga animated,
They met each other, riding horse, And then became unseparated.
But something more us separated...
Appolo’s children took it sacred; For Albion proud lyre rated
At least he’d my advice have held: Refuse the modes antiquated,
Among the songs in books decrepit Somewhere issued was that lilt; Triquet with poet’s keen wit For world from dust that rhyme extracted,
But who is that, in throng selected, Is standing mute and unaffected?
Ah, feet, in vain I was affected.
That their friendship never ends; By unreflected rays effected,
Who glory, money and the ranks In turn and quietly effected,
The wiser I should get each day: My deeds and rhymes to have corrected,
His house stood in place selected, From winds by mountains protected,
The caravan of crying geese For south fleeted. And unwaited
The powder, by grey parts handed, On shelf is falling; an indented,
To him among the lines all printed His eyes in spirit always hinted
Inheritage, he had by then, Not seeing loss in all, he wasted
Some wines to me are not ajusted, Remind a lady-lover rusted,
By one mistrustful old man; Him stately cuckold admitted,
And gave this person all the beauty, And made him wrongly persecuted;
The shining skies are now blued.
That hermit idle and despondent Yet recently in winter lived
For district mothers pleasant image - The regimental chief arrived.
All that I gladlessly survived.
But now doubts all are solved:
You came to me when I was sleeping, Unseen you were to me beloved,
Past clans; the charming dreams of love, Antique moralities beloved.
Was she feeling; That he then really was moved,
Feocrite, Gomer were reproved, Yet Adam Smith was well approved,
By chance I met you long ago. A spark of tenderness you showed.
My father gave consent to wed.
His life’s monotonous and is mixed, The same for many days is fixed,
Decayed...
Her role how firmly played,
Some round dance away disperses: Behind the river smoked, blazed
To meet the scholar world’s desire I could describe, you’d be amazed.
Was seeming new on each occasion, With jokes innocence amazed.
His nose, shoulders could raise The general, by her amazed.
His conscience Lensky was revealing, His own soul criticized.
Two poles glued by halves of floe (Disastrous, trembling little aid)
On them attentive eyes are fixing By will and passion of the maid.
Some lively rots in long a tale Or hearty letters of young maid.
To bring her features clear, plain, Simplicity of country maid
But that will do; adieu is [node: For madness tribute you have paid.
Unlucky Larina was going (To waste the money was afraid)
In hope that by future friend Of me some sound will be said.
‘Well, he is killed’,- the neighbour said.
I write to you - what more or other To add to all by this is said?
Returned; without extra word always ready - shortly said.
But suddenly could part from it, As I from my Onegin did,
Some frame and lace for working fit, In silk embroider never did.
Critic strictly Demands from us: be getting rid
And what for is can now lurid?
To object of his love and hymns, To beauty dear, nicely languid.
Can daily headlong ride full speed; When she alone in the field
My poor Tanya sits, can’t sleep, And looks into the darkling field.
Alas! my Eugene, no doubts, With Tanya is in love like child;
As sign of lust for future being The master of her home, child
He calmly sleeps in bed, retired From pastimes, flourishing big child.
Her head; is seeming to be ready For deep a faint, this being mild;
‘You see, Tatyana’s not a child,’ The old woman’s voice is mild,-
And we adored, like in a dream, Some song of horn and man, such bold...
Sad and cold,
What chatters!.. Blood in her runs cold...
He speeds her up the forest road; Through trees is seen a dwelling old,
The sleigh has stopped; to auntie old, Consumptive now, to behold
‘Vladimir Lensky here’s lain, He met his death like man quite hold
Of course, it would be so bold, Describing is what I must hold.
Him scenting, horses on the road All snort, and travellers quickly hold:
And rent the ear-rings of gold; Then brittle snows fastly hold
Her thought is hiking everywhere, Forgotten are the bail, the world.
Or will he be a lad good natured Like you and I, like all the world?
Enough in common way with him We wandered in the world.
Enough he fooled the whole world? At least he’d my advice have held: Refuse the modes antiquated. Enough he fooled the whole world…
And may be tracks of secret fear Of own husband and of world
For pranks or weakness of the dear... (That’s all he knew in own world...)
At boring stage some known actor, And, turning to unknown world
With thirst of soul all them held; And she discovered other world.
At once behind the door awakens The sound of bassoon from band:
By post-chase he headlong went, Was yawning sweetly before hand,
More brave than sound man, a grand His message wants to send: weak hand
Does not remove from lips his gasping Her quite insensible small hand...
To come to tables hand in hand.
You’ll hardly meet to-day a maiden With Russian magazine in hand.
Tatyana hardly sighs, the man Addresses her with verse in hand
The tea’s been brought; the quiet maidens Are taking saucers into hand,
She’s troubled by the jealous trend: As if some cold foe’s hand
In languish of the heart remorses He pressed his pistol in his hand,
His heart, Vladimir qickly penned At tomb a madrigal by hand.
Hurra! we all have reached the land.
His father didn’t understand Arid put in pledge the whole land,
They bless the harmful ruts of land And ditches of the fatherland.
And you, my reader dear, gracious, In your borouch from other land
‘Ah, will you do a favour, nanny?’ -All right, my dear, you command.-
Or in the garden hand in hand They walk at morning so grand;
Meanwhile his eyes off her can’t tear Some general important, grand.
The love; who cooled it with divorcement, By scandal enmity could strand,
That uhlan’s loved by all her soul… At altar now does she stand
Not grasping ways to understand
THE END
Of dreadful fancy all the meanings Tatyana wants to find the end.
Indeed, for long should have the end!
I know, you were sent by goodness, You’ll be my guard until the end,
He’s blessed, who feast of life was leaving In time, not drinking to the end
What’s the end?
She’s trembling in the heat of fever,	 For him she waits and doesn’t hear That in the garden maidens sing, While they are gathering, not seen, In bushes berries: they were given To sing strict order (while they job To make them banns not to rob As berries never could be eaten: In country they invented then The way the banns to defend!),
And by degrees but is beginning Tatyana him to comprehend -
The love, the plants, the void, the village, The fields! to you I’m staunch a friend.
With Pelagéya Nikolávna The same’s monsieur, her Fine-Mouche, friend,
With might and main he’ll you defend With love of kinsman, not of friend!
Is not it so, friend?
My life has been a pawn but fruitless Of meeting with my dear friend;
But sequels of the sudden meeting To-day, my dear reader-friend,
They’ve made me marry other man; And I’ll be true to him till end!
To me true compass now lend
At dawn who never knows yet The evening where will he spend.
From Eugene differ I my image, To note this I always trend,
To doctors he is being sent. The doctors him to waters send.
I’ll simply say without fevers: If previous idol I could find,
I loved you, I for love had hunger, But what in all your heart could find?
To ask you: leave, do not be funny. You know, in your heart I find
Such subject’s worthy of your mind: More gentle never you will find.
The movings, voice, the figure fine, All Olga has... but you can find
Or dismal eye will never find
Could my Onegin now find.
Of feelings quickly came to mind, But now weakly lag behind.
To hostess a lady’s heading, Some plump grand general’s behind.
You are, my Moscow, beloved of Russia daughter, and where can we find some other of the kind..
But, being wife, she willy-nilly Yet sighed for man of other kind,
The old man had no time To read the books of other kind.
And how, with your heart and mind, To he the slave of sense, not kind?
His soul’s warmed with inspiration By lady’s greetings, friendly kind.
In winter darkness of the night Was captivating heart and mind.
Forgotten features can remind.
She’s writing, on the table leaning, And always Eugene’s kept in mind,
My poor mind...
‘You tell me, prince, if don’t mind,
Implacable at their ages, Inscrutable for all my mind;
On branches of the pine permissive Sometimes an early morning wind
Is really the secret’s found?
The girls are jumping all around.
She now from the hill comes down, And hardly breathing looks around
On third day, looking all around, He saw nor copse, nor hill, nor ground;
The hall is full of crowd; The music’s weary of sound;
‘But how did you marry, nanny?’ -It was by wish of God.
Last evening frightful words I’d heard; Thank God!
By us the habits have been got Instead of happiness from God.
With education, as you know, We all can shine, and bless it God!
In hearty letter, as its sender, He was slipshod.
The old woman was admired By that advice, such simple, good;
She has been shuddered, but is mute, She eyes Onegin as some good,
He tried, but of the work persistent He felt yet sickness. Nothing good
Of Moscow young graces good
In village cuckold but good, In wadded overall with hood
At the games of maidenhood.
And you, well known dear wood, And charming skies of neighbourhood.
In flame by wit to cool each minute The agitation in the blood;
Shortly each from other Were drifted they by thirst of blood.
But now - God! - is cooling blood
In cold heart is kindling blood... Again the grief, of love the flood!
By turbid brooks have run all down To meadows, all under flood.
Not long ago they like brothers Divided meals, ideas, flood
But when her thanks for termination To Eugene came, tier languid mood,
Long since the girl began to languish, Could burn in bliss, in dismal mood,
Each topic’s argued at the meetings: To meditate they were in mood
For long Onegin couldn't bear That tragical and nervous mood
Each day was shorter at the noon, The secret canopy of wood
Yet limpid is the near wood
He isn’t more… The youngling bard
My poor Lensky with his heart For such a life was born, young bard.
Forgive me, isn’t it too hard?’ -For me it’s not - ‘But dear bard,
It Tanya knew of near duel, At least the day before had heard
Of droshky light, remote noise From Million street was heard.
Bewildered and astonished hard...
Of years young but whithered hard,
Of old age triumphant customs At home were supported hard:
The winter had been longed by nature, In January it snowed hard.
She looks, and all her own heart More often’s heating and more hard.
The fixing time; the poor bard In silence drops his pistol hard
To loose his colour he’s beginning: She doesn’t see or she’s too hard!?
But they would madden it too hard.
The killer of his brother-bard; The bard is dead... and that is hard,
Has found end untimely hard!
For evening whist who’s coming briskly, Sits down, plays not very hard,
And exclamations at the board:
On sledge the corpse, all icy, lone, He’s taking home dreadful hoard,
They say, they’d got For that the best in world reward.
’Whose glance, exciting inspiration, With sweet caress gave best reward
Report for him was so sudden From steward:
She enters a deserted yard.
The time was coming, dull and hard: November stood in front of yard.
That year pretty autumn weather Too long was staying on in yard,
My dear early little bird!
He is seeking New ways. The second day, the third
‘Ah, my Lord!’,
For quiet leisure after work; For lively pictures, salted word;
Of course, he thinks, ‘I could be scornful To alt his funny, lying word;
And no nonsense in the world Or epigram with brutal word
The enmity’s afraid in world Of eyes derisive, scornful word!
And stilly neared me in calmness. I think its you with love and brightness Could whisper full of hopes word.
With fizz by bottle wine be pouring While saying clever pncky word -
Prepared for the sake of money To sighs, to boredom and to fraud
By vernal rays all driven now From hills the snows, turned to mud,
The barks, the smacks of kissing maids, The crush, the laugh, the noise are loud.
With goat’s beard sits a hag; She sees sceleton stiff and proud,
Around Tanya ladies crowd,
To look at life like at the rite, And follow the decent crowd,
With time I’d smooth and then might be I’d find a friend to suit my soul, Would be a loyal wife on whole, And virtuous mother I would be.
His everyday employments rather In details I should well describe.
But I… it doesn’t bother me: To old times I’ll loyal be.
It all was simple: floors of oak, Divan, the table, large wardrobe,
Dear! come to rue… As in a dream it seems to be...
For long has chance with us to be?
If by my lot I were convicted A husband, father just to be,
Alas! young bride, if she were trying, To sadness loyal couldn’t be.
But dear friends, it all is useless: If I in future won’t be
From pistol he, not being rattled, At fifteen metres stuck the ace.
Unmovingly he lay, and queer Was heavy brow’s languid peace.
Among Moldavian dismal thickets She visited marquees in peace
Nor by her pleasant ruddy freshness She’d catch one’s eyes by simple face.
With tender soul, clear sense Him gave attractive handsome face,
They had invited several maids With never smiling, sullen face;
Could not repeat, yet being shameless, That I could scribble own face
Some madridgal of old days, And presses hand; at once her face
And though Eugene, as we know, For long from reading turned his face,
In afternoon they squash and crowd, In drawing room they meet new face;
All over the Baltic waves For forest, fat and hand-made lace;
They take away the chairs, plates, Them call, they give the friends a place.
In which for winter had a place. Storm windows, the fire-place
But then a frenchman took her place.
What foolish, dumpy is this place!
At start of novel good ideal In thicket of a distant place,
Insults all proud paltry males: The wit them presses, needs a space?
Will show my renowned face And say: ‘It’s poet of grace!’
The boy was frisky but with grace.
But several books of common row Himself excluded from disgrace:
But well, she’s named Tatyana; gladless, Nor by her sister’s pretty grace,
Of instant thought some slight a trace, But of the same for years race.
At any novel those features, Her own portrait, very nice;
It may be, with itself has carried Some sacred secret; evil choice
Not very long he could behold The girls as object of his choice;
And all entrust in singing voice The secrets of the maiden’s choice,
Yet speaks of Him; and she avoids The sounds of the tender voice
And many boys with joyful cries Are scaring on sonorous ice;
Tatyana’s flushing, all she’s trembling - To be to-day he promised me,- Vladimir answers, - may be, he For post now yet is waiting.- Tatyana stands, she drops her eyes As if reproached by the vice.
Was always punished wicked vice, And good was given garlands twice.
What joy: to-day we’ll have to dance!
With Olga Tanya; quickly rather Onegin Olga took for dance.
Not stopping coming in advance, The first of them to catch a chance.
The guessing songs and round dance, On all Whitsundays caught a chance,
The door of coffin was unclosed: To have new wreath he got a chance;
The colonel sent it for the chance.
Sometimes with own blood she wrote To lady’s album if by chance,
He bowed. Unattending body, At stage he looked as if by chance,
For words of love to be entreating, First move of heart to catch by chance,
But breget bells are now clinking: New ballet will begin by chance,
But none a thought for days is flashing; At neither random nor by chance
Tatyana’s pale and dismal charms, Her hair down let by chance,
But like a house all deserted It’s dark and still, and not by chance
The habits sugared all her woe Which wasn’t smoothed by any chance:
Comes in, of dead has strong resemblance.
Meanwhile her soul’s feelings moan, Her tears filled her languid glance...
My Lensky’s feelings all were smeared, He was afraid at her to glance.
Then changed in strict and quick a mode The maiden’s names by names from France,
None soul’s seen in rooms at entrance...
She’s mere infant, But yet coquette! A giddy instance!
The boys got dogs behind the fence And took the maiden for defence.
The yard was under snow dense: Parterres, roofs and all the fence;
Ah, never impulse of the sense Put rack my soul ever hence.
Turned off, then yawned and said at once:
They rush into the yard at once!
But soon she all was full of go, By it she calmed herself at once:
He was enabled, slightly rushing, To speak of anything at once,
But soon for husband, all at once,
It’s mute for ever all at once.
Was asking Olya him at once
Buyánov, my quick-temperd brother, To Eugene brought two girls at once:
The thirst demands some more of drinking To cool hot cutlet’s fat at once,
To grasp that time he had a chance, But as a student he’s a dunce.
But he is stubborn: to renounce Unfit, yet hopes, hustles; bounce
You hear voice of little source, You see grave-stone small and coarce
Away from Eugene’s lips; morose, He’s awkward, hardly has he force
Or tenderer - like little moth Which sucks spring flower with force;
The heirs of estate, all cross, Obscenely disputes try to force.
He looks al her with tender ardour; He’s yet beloved with previous force,
And heated by the pure passion This agitated person bade
Boom could fade.
But his such sufferable shade,
In winter, when the night’s weak shade
Arrives he now every day; Her follows like own shade:
All’s blight, all’s white without shade.
Like London dandy, well arrayed, First coming to the world he made.
He sang of how life could fade; All that in his teenage he made.
Sometimes she beat a house-maid, - All that not asking man she made.
Perhaps, in Lethe won’t perish My verse, by wit and heart well made;
I can’t foresee any objection To this representation made.
And at the brook in thickened shade Is put a monument just made.
By winter carpets, snow-made.
All peasants-men there are enriching, They get the silver with a spade,
In man’s attire all arrayed, The goddess comes to masquerade.
Who made his life not cooled, but useful, With years could his aims abide;
Sometimes Onegin was surprised, With what could mutely coincide;
He’s handsome, rich, of fair manner. And neighbours said: he needs a bride.
For husband then she was yet bride.
Some real honour and the pride.
Was talking much of them with pride.
With secret grief I read this matter, While reading cannot put aside.
‘...can’t sleep, it’s stuffy, you unclose The window and sit beside...’
A young two-horned the moon at sky, But at unusual left the side,
The highways Russia will unite, Connect and cross its any side;
Was terribly unsatisfied. With every man at any side
The talks are saved for time much better: The mouths chew, From every side
Young ladies on the floor all glide But yet in towns, countryside
‘You tell of those Your old times... I’ve boring tide..’
Tatyana to the yard, such wide,
Cast-iron bridges over waters Will go like a bow wide;
God knows, whom by words you dart; Of elegies the precious code
Recalling former love, such free, Perceptible and carefree,
He so used to live in visions That he could go mad quite free
And stubbornly he looks; but she Is sitting quietly, she’s free.
In tender manner they agree.
CHAPTER THREE
They whisper her, You, Doonya, see!
The gardens, chambers before me I could at once all gathered see!
To fix her fate it’s time, I see;
It means: my noon has come, its needed For me to realize, I see.
The drive to Moscow! It means the world to see!
And by the people’s usual custom On Christmas must we come to see;
‘D’you think.’ indeed... suspicions any… But do you see...
Diana’s breasts, the cheeks of Flora Delightful are, my freinds, you see!
‘If I would wish to have restricted My life by family, you see,
My cousin dear, Sit down... complex is the life!
But was my Eugene satisfying By being free in prime of life,
And dreams, that she with him as wife Will pass the peaceful mute of life!
Some darkling blessing to invite To know better bliss of life
‘To me, Onegin, all this splendour, This tinsel of repelling life,
As well as seeds in vital strife In earth by spring are given life.
By children and by loyal wife With candid never seen in life.
Alas! for funs, which can be differed, I’ve ruined much of own life.
Who’s waiting for her husband sadly Alone daily all her life.
Not having any higher passion To rhymes to dedicate his life,
And thought of her in him inspired First moan of his conscious life.
‘In all the world its most badly To see in family the wife
It looked for him through all his life Like own shade or loyal wife.
With war; with magazine’s white lie; With snow and with own wife,
Among the children would he die At hands of doctors, weepers, wife.
Besides, opinions of the husband By very good and virtuous wife
With medal for Ochakov playing, Intended Olga for my wife
‘But who is she?’ She is my wife,
Can live like real wise a ma7i: Like that Horatius with cabbage
They were some secret good traditions Of tender, shady old age:
At boring aunt’s my Tanya meeting Once Vyasemisky in his good age
With Tanya Lensky; Kharlikóva, The bride of more than ripening age,
For mill they all have had resolved At dawn in time to come in carriage
You lie, young hard, in peace all age!’
Such time what can you do in village?
With Russian hammer and the might Return to sleighs the foreign image;
Directs it constantly, each minute At her, who by her own image
At such a year, such an age.
It was neglected., large in gauge, Of dryads shelter for an age.
A bloody roast-beef is given, And truffles, splendour of teenage,
Then let the poet enraged To play the fool: at his teenage
Of young delirium high rage.
As legends say of old age (For that we’d praise in him the sage).
And great belief in world’s perfection, Forgive him ardour of his age,
Who killed at duel friend his own, Had lived without aim, this sage,
With him be keeping, and the sledge To park in field not far from hedge.
All neighbours came by closed sleigh, By hooded carts, by britzkas, sledge...
I don’t grudge: why should I grudge?
- Princess, mon ange! -
To all he seems to be some strange; In front of him the faces range
He can’t give happiness at large’.
She waited, looked and anyhow She said: well, yes! it must be He
And then in secret could defame them By merry jest or real he.
In it, sometimes, on rare sundays At window, in glasses, he
My poor Lensky! badly pining Not very long was weeping she.
Yes, It is he...
Who’s he?
And she insensibly is drifting, She doesn’t move and doesn’t breathe;
But I was born for peaceful living, In village stillness gladly breathe,
He couldn’t be a bard for ever, He didn’t go mad or die,
In brackets I would like to note: You haven’t more insulting lie,
The lilt, well known round me: Reveilles vous, belle endormie.
As now not at any time He could bear-steaks and Strassburg pie
Tatyana with her eyes amazing A look at everything can take,
All lots that time became alike; And then I married, I would like
To him for tree, mysterious rather: Forbidden fruit to have you’d like, Or Eden to itself’s unlike.
- D’you joke -
I’m hiking round pretty lake, Some flocks of ducks by chance awoke,
The field is dark in pretty gale...
Before arrival; anyhow She isn’t bothered (that’s female!);
Against Tatyana in a row They sit. Of morning moon more pale
The autumn golden is coming, The nature’s now trembling, pale
Sometimes could keep his answer dark; Sometimes a quarrel could enable
It is forgivable.
And give you all that 1 could scribble
‘But they will have a throng of people And all the other rabble feeble..?.
Where is that sullen gloomy crank, The killer of the bard such feeble?’
Onegin was in eyes of people, (Which were in judgements strict, not feeble,)
Impossible!?
Arid, following Petrarka’s tracks, Could calm his heart’s the biggest trouble.
By this half-tormenting a ramble, By table with a faded candle,
And youth of those vanished days All after her could wildly dangle;
To have a breakfast three together Could make them quickly reconcile,
Perhaps I’ll grieve if in a while
Of old times the heat of feeling, May be, could capture for a while;
The girl appeared! Laugh was wild!. They all stood gaping for a while,
Of love mad sufferings she’s feeling . Without ceasing for a while
To grieve, to talk of new affairs, To laugh, to gossip for a while,
But after first cordial greeting Zaretsky’s silent for a while
They argue louder; he’s getting Some long a knife; in short a while
Meanwhile
Iambus he, at frank confession, From trochee couldn’t tell meanwhile.
At Simeon’s he’s now Living. He saw me at Twelfth-night sometime, His son was married then meanwhile.
Without mincing style was shining, But interrupted was meanwhile
We must meanwhile
To jokes mixtured with the bile, To epigrams with no smile.
His epigram’s unwaited file Could make all pretty ladies smile.
I don’t like the Russian speeches Without grammar incompleteness, As well as lips without smile.
Of sad misgivings she is full, Foresees misfortunes as a rile.
La, sotto i giorni nubilosi e brevi, 			Nasce una gente a cui i’morir non dole.
Because uncautious ardent soul Annoys, ridicules, as a whole
At last like dead to petrify In deadly thrill of world on whole;
Your glance made languish me far love, Your voice was touching all my feeling For long... But that was not a dreamt You came, at once I got to know: Inflamed and heated I was whole.
I don’t mean to please grand people.
Revealed his own soul simple, Meanwhile malevolance of people
With hard emotion yet tender I am enjoyed by breath such gentle
They see encircled by its grove Petrovsky castle.
Good-bye, the witness of past glory, Petrovsky castle.
Each man has enemies, but yet From friends defend us God a little
While he prefered to play a steed. His finger’s frozen a little,
On table leaning with slight press, Are sitting, lost in thought. a little,
We knew the game of passion’s oath; By life were anguished as a rule;
In winter here they had dinner With Lensky, neighbour late, as rule...
I now see, of it confessing, That even my such poor style
It happened. When thunder of mazurka came,
The love’s foregone, the muse appeared, And clearer my mind became,
Such men (I’m first of them to blame) From boredom dear friends became,
They friends became.
Child-Harold’s copy, grim, morose To inner rooms and halls he came;
Of linden alleys dimmish To places where he then came.
But Tanya’s heart yet isn’t gladdened, To meet the winter never came,
As they them wrote many years Of might, as it through ages came..’
In own village to appear New landlord in a droshky came,
I’m free, but look for union, geared In sound, sense and temper game/
They all are family the same, The sons of greedy bore at game.
Of art high muses fine impressions He, happy, never put to shame,
By love intoxicated, Embarrassed by the tender shame,
Enough, my friend, its all the same!
Its morning: everyone again Is up. To her it’s all the same.
To him she doesn’t pay attention, You strive or die, it is the same:
‘Well, no, just the same...
Between two aunts at column now, Not seen by anyone that tame,
But road alarm of love then filled me.
Ah, no one, my friends, believe me!
Forgive me’.
With my request immodest, gladless I’d trouble you for helping me:
To play the cards was used with me.
‘But now tell;’ she says, ‘to me: Whom did you see in dream with me?’
The bard of feasts, of languid sadness, you had chance to stay with me,
My friends, on bard you’d have a pity: Of hopes rain-bowed at prime
‘Where are, where are withdrawn you now The golden days of life my prime?
I ask: be patient for a time;
Some neighbours said of the impression That wedding had some pointed time,
All services of old time.
And placid, solidly effected, In style of clever old time.
Quite sad for me is your occurence, The spring, the spring! of love the time!
Can hiss; with bearings important, By couplets tortured all the time,
‘Who might be thinking... all the time!
From cold world of dissipation To fade away not having time,
Nor longest years of the partings, Nor all to muses given time,
In wonder style To every place he came in time.
To have a rest and have a hike, That’s why I’ll finish other time.
In icy bottle for the poet Sometimes is brought at proper time.
For long is weeping she this time.
And passed away of tears time?
To her is drinking first, his rhyme He gives to Tanya at that time.
For world has done yet nothing titling, To grow male yet hadn’t time
Of course, of him I’ll quickly know,- For him I now haven’t time.
You must remember that day time,
Is drawn, in turn I’ve bad nay time.
For that at distance poor dwelling, For place, in which the first toy time,
Among his properties alone, To pass away his lazy time,
When I to wretchers was assisting Or by the prayer was releasing From stress my soul within me.
It was well known friendly wellcome:
To make the friends embroiled become, Made friends to barrier to come;
Next day has come...
Of three kibitkas transport own Can bring belongings of the home:
His life was calm, without woe. Sometimes his neighbours in his home
But are you listening yet to me?
It’s true; to you I had boon listening, In stillness spoke. you to me
‘Well... I, my nanny… don’t know... For love I’m longing, dear me!
O’key, but let us part not frigid. Ah, youth my light! Ah, dear me!
She’s after me.
A poet by will of goodness, New devil then will enter me;
By nothing bound, I’m a stranger: I thought: the freedom, peace for me
And how often muse my tender Delighted silent route for me
Somewhere you could look at me, But harmful is the North for me,
But foot, such small, of Terpsichore More charming somewhat is for me.
Or could be poet with reasons (And I confess - could favour me).
Goodness me!
Its nicer, friends, much more when he Is wailing foolishly: its me!
And she is squeaking (dear me!): In gold chamber visit me!...
To village own took her soon; But she was often in a fume,
«Freischutz» lovely tune But played by pupils in a Fume.
It will sometime all us illume, Will gift the world some blessed perfume.
Ideal image, Tanya’s rhyme...
By chance his verse yet anyhow Is kept by me; you read this rhyme;
In brackets to the point I’d note: In all my verses, by my rhyme
Could catch the glory by the way: But I in love was dumb, inane.
She sees: the room is light again, Through window’s a frosty pane
My dashing Eugene?
‘Here’s He! that’s Eugene!
At home had to work a lot; And he went out; but my Eugene
That time, when in lyceum’s gardens I flourished quickly, quite serene,
Until his breget sleepless, fine Will strike the bells for him to dine.
Forbidding goddess, guile inventive, Of reigning, sumptuous Neva fine.
To try to find in Russia whole Of them three pairs straight and fine.
I could define
And even this my chapter five — From all digressions to refine.
She-neighbour her to outshine, Herself is though dazzling, fine.
The days were speeding; heated air Could mean: the spring is coining fine;
But now, heartily I though Do love my hero fine,
With all her cooling beauty lone Did like the Russian winter fine:
‘Onegin, then I was much younger And, seems to me, much more was fine,
The honoured castle was erected Like all such castles: it was fine
A forest stands; a stout pine Is still and frowned, yet is fine
A bottle of some light sweet wine, Some solitude, the stillness fine:
Yet outside, as well’s inside, The lanterns everywhere shine;
Unbearable is at rout Of mere dinners see a line
He wanted to establish own, In orders newer fashioned line:
My memory is dark.., I’m granny... And much forgot... of life the line
They now play the eighth of roberts, Of whist the braves; eight times in line
Like idol, - you, Omir divine, - For three millenniums in line,
Allow me, the readers mine, To show you her elder line.
And where is her sister line?
At nameless river, small and fine. In village where Eugene mine,
And what can give me fate of mine?’
I write it, as for long my time I haven’t any sin of mine.
I simply wrote Of idle, blackish dreams of mine;
What languid agitation current There is in blood and soul mine!
To me that time you were quite right,’ To you is grateful soul mine...
To lesson yours attended I, To-day, you see, the turn is mine.
All point at her, such young and fine, And all they cry: ‘It’s mine! Its mine’
Alas, it’s easy to divine!
’He’s ignoramus’, said the neighbours, ’He is free-thinker, drinks red wine
And now, free from humid stopper, Each bottle bangs and all the wine
Of ‘Clicquot widow’ or ‘Moet` Some blessed and fine the dry white wine
At Verrey’s every morning’s time On credit drank three quarts of wine.
The plates and covers jointly clatter, The glasses clink, all filled with wine.
Between blancmanger and roasts fine They now bring the Tsimlyan wine.
I like the friendly idle speakings And friendly howl of sweet wine
The whiskers and the bloody tongues, The horns and fingers made of bone -
Her own house they have come; The door wide open was done
Who was unmodest, who by bristle. An answer, other trifles done,
She like the moon to shine has come Among the wives and maids the one.
Pm sure... none, They’ll be the family, the one.
To twenty six of own age. Was weary at leisure one
Well, I remember... has he gone?
You poets, are queer!’ -Good bye, Onegin, time has gone.
At first they came to him for visit But as he usually was gone
While at the moon Tatyana’s looking, By own heart away she’s gone...
When she recovered she is looking: Some inner porch... the bear's gone;
Has withered at the morning dawn., The fire at the altar’s gone.
Unlucky victim, Lensky’s gone...
‘I don’t hamper you, but dear, For evenings where have you gone?
Have less in difference between Each one.
But let it go: at this rate To strive against myself alone
In them he draws the country whole, The Kyprid’s temple, graves alone:
Does not make cows go out, And when at noon they are forlone,
But happiness of youth has gone Like light foot-prints in fields forlone.
‘You, nanny, let me stay forlone.
With wreath, ashamed, his hand in hand, With drooping head, as if yet lone,
Through kitchen-garden they went home; They came together; no one
-But no one...
Already I of plan was thinking, Of name of person number one,
CHAPTER ONE
From novel’s only beginning — I’ve finished now chapter one.
Could make of clever fool for ever, Explicit or implicit one.
Meanwhile we all. of Hymen foes, In home life yet see but one
And he with pleasure long ago Was meeting him; that’s why at borne
Replace the fortune.
Or roses of flaming cheeks, Or bosom, which awaits for fortune.
‘I’ll perish, - says my Tanya’s voice - From him to die is pleasant fortune.
More sweet, than joys beneath the moon, Will stay of Torkwat’s octaves tune!
But such amusements, yet important, Are worthy of an old ape
He’s blessed, who in his youth was youthful! He’s blessed, who well in time was ripe.
By now from a distant village The idol of the ladies ripe,
Of thoughts dead capital again To raise from dead you’ll give a hope;
His Olga’s jumping from the porch Like feather-brained and trail a hope:
You’ll perish, but before you go, You try in dazzling pretty hope
The foes put the capes on steppe.
And hostile shore, I shall be rushing To come to midday desert steppe
Ah, don’t mind’ -My friend, by God to hail I dare —
One vision always, everywhere, The rime desire comes to dare
To keep the happy stirrup dare...
Can’t now blame: that dreadful time To be more honest could you dare;
What does next day for me prepare?
‘I see, in world you’ve been too rare...
To go on with calm a talk, To fix at you the joyful stare!..
In vain I try to be aware,
You didn’t like me; What has happened, That after me you now are?
My mother in her bitter tears Implored to yield; for Tanya here
(Not speaking of the verses frames). The education can’t adhere
The banks of stopped, unmoving river By shroud are equated here.
Meanwhile they most be not a mock, But honourable..!’ - l could here
He thinks of here:
On leave the gussars hasten here
And even by her trembling hands To lift her dress ashamed she's here;
Who wrote comedies with joy; With glory Didla’s crowned there.
And there… -
Like women, books were all left here,
He isn’t here...
The smile of lips, the move of eyes To catch by loving eyes somewhere;
My goddesses’ what are you? where?
The kin from distant places rare Have tender welcome everywhere,
To see you more to have a chance. To follow you everywhere;
To judgings by the world severe
To ride a horse in steppe severe?
I’d like anew to warn all you: You, mothers, should be more severe,
Was teaching him with ready jest, With morals never was severe,
But what severe!
The fisher’s fire.
Yet being child, in children’s throng To play and jump had none desire,
But when Vladimir disappeared, Onegin, languished by the bore,
His heart is pressed, fulfilled with bore,
They speak to him of no more, But being bachelor is bore;
Italian nights I shall adore.
And far niente is my law.	 I wake at mornings to adore
To us: from it we have not more Than mincing manners to adore.
Like heat are shining crosses dear; They guilded cupolas adore.
Yes, I shall come, I’ll come!’ - before
The shepherd’s singing as before And makes bast sandal more and more.
Reliably well screwed the flint Is cocked once more.
Or Cleopatra may encore (By others to be heard once more).
Did never touch hire as before, He caught the sight of nothing more.
Much more... -
And in the solitude severe Her passion’s heating yet much more,
Was lost in thought; to Olga near Revengeful words said no more.
Still humble, deaf like long before, Still eats and drinks for two or more.
Iván Petróvich’s fool and bore, Semyón Petróvich stints yet more;
She’s running - he is after her; She can’t be running any more,
The tears of the people’s awe. Katenin there could restore
Malfilatre.
The secret drives in sledge rehearse; But I am ready to endure
Are full of piety, of wit, Such cautious, that we can’t endure,
Will get some favourable deal, And afterwards they’ll not endure
Between affairs and the leisure She found out with a pleasure
You, dreams, my dreams, where is your pleasure And rhyme to it: my youth, my treasure ?
It’s right, of course, but trends of fashion, But of the nature willful pressure,
They all can find her somewhat queer Provincial and affected creature
And she, that young and lovely creature;
Devoted to childish leisure 1 hike at lake in desert nature,
Expresses death but not the torture.
The health, the prime of life, its sweetness, The smile, the innocent calm ease,-
To rescue, to his hones - peace In grave, in mother-soil at ease!’
He under chest was wounded here, The blood yet steaming flew at ease.
Between the Limburg lively cheese And best pine-apple gold squeese.
With dreams and heart of old days In her this time again could raise.
A smooth-tongued voice of world, it happened, His evil bravery could praise:
Eternal choir or the waves, To lord of world the hymn of praise.
In gallery the claps are flying, And rising curtain makes a noise.
Mazurka is the crowd’s choice; All round are crush and noise;
He’s languished by the hits rebuffing, Attentive in the still and noise
Can press her heart, or a misfortune, That waits for her, is black, makes noise.
His passions were too quickly cold, And he was bored by worldly noise;
Aggressive lenders each offends, Each has his own wit and sense.
Believe (for bail I give my conscience), The wedlock will be poignant nonsense.
The boston, gossips were in vain, Or dear looks or sighs - all those
Of traitresses quite young at all, Of mates despised a circle close;
What purpose?
In them in stillness of the day He real tears could expose;
My age inclines for strict a prose, Against light rhymes my age arose
The morning pleasant noise arose.
But wave and stone, The ice and flame, the verse and prose
I thought that time: will do, perhaps; But what d’you think? again collapse!’
The breath is fading in her lips, She heard some noise, her eyes did glimpse...
But I my fruits of dreams am reading, And my harmonious ventured verse
He’ll fascinate you, I am sure, By picturing in flaming verse
For me the glory bring, of course: Wry talks, the noise, a lot of curse!
He can’t endure such a blow; The whims of women he can curse.
In shade of branch some simple cross On grave of dear, poor nurse.
I live and write not for applause,
But well, its time I should be busy: The beauty’s letter I should use.
With scornful bitter contemplation Your proud look will me refuse!
To Petushkóv she never goes; Pykhtín, the hussar, toed to fuse
For Russian heart too much is fused And echoed in it through muse!
Accept you all my thankful feelings Admirer of peaceful muse,
He doesn’t gather them with horn. A maiden’s singing in her house,
He sees some smelted snow; now, As if he sleeps in some doss-house,
There is a place not tar from house In which inspired bard could rouse.
What’s use?
Incautious, likely, I was, but me could supplicate
And with Onegin’s recollecting Some jokes, pranks of old date,
And parents foresaw the fate: Were calculating wedding date;
Fonvizin shone, a friend of freedom, Knyazhnin was always up-to-date.
In life with us like new it’s hiking, And hardly will it have good fate.
Indeed, d’you have this kind of mate Destined to your severe. fate?
Sometimes will give you all the rate Of all your own real fate.
The heart of somebody he’ll cherish, Arid, kept by touch of truthful fate,
The corvee yoke changed for rate, And serfs were blessing their fate.
Two bullets - fitting at this rate - Will quickly settle all his fate.
All my confessions must you take: For judgement yours I give my fate.
I can’t I am at will your own And I give up to all my fate.
But my fate
They sat. The aging sleigh is sliding, Is stilly crawling through the gate.
At Kharitónya’s in the alley In front of house at the gate
I very much this word am liking, But cannot I this word translate,
I have without any doubts Tatyana’s letter to translate.
It’s late.
Let us sing in gaiety Song of maidens intimate,
‘Forgive, my place, my peaceful mate!
As pawn that’s worth of dear mate.
But fate for us was never steady: For long we had to separate.
Is brought a long way off by fate, They must for ever separate.
With love friends’ notions I’d rate
Onegin was already ready With me some foreign lands to rate,
And all to her it seems quite wealthy, Revives her languid soul’s rate
Upstairs to the highest rate.
I can your frankness estimate, It made my feelings agitate
And could of high oppressive order All manners quickly imitate!
Enchanting land! In days of wisdom, Of satire great potentate,
He is suspending This quite unpleasant tete-a-tete.
The poet in heat of judgement Some nothern poem could cite,
But they, to whom at friendly meeting My first of stanzas could I cite...
The capital’s high pick was there, Of fashion patterns, the elite.
By their poetic light He own soul did ignite.
Are not, or far away are living, As Sadi said before I write.
To such an album, being tight, If to confess, I’d like to write,
His French was so perfect now, That he could chat, as well as write,
Green tables are prepaired now, All active players they invite:
About feasts, enormous, fine, About meals and corks I wrote
Be glad with such a man… You smart With rare wit your letter wrote!
Each other day be seen I must, That I am rich in wealthy caste?
All things by Paris craft invented To help the idle hungry taste
Enrolled dandies show here The impudence and fine gillette
While looking after girls, and yet At them keep strictly your lornette!
And unattentive smart lornette.
Alas, Tatyana’s daily fading: She’s paling, sinking and is mute,
Of girls, the tears, faints not rare: Enough he had them all en route.
She courted… at once decided: To Moscow by winter route!
Some kind of trouble was him teasing: For change of places secret cue
Tatyana now sighs and moans, The letter’s trembling on her palm, The wafer’s drying on her own Inflamed by fever rigid tongue.
The night has many stars, all charming; The brightest one at heaven’s blue
And as a law for me imputing Of passions tyrany unique,
But all the nothern Russian summer Of south winter bad burlesque:
By new one can’t I be admired I pity old one - it’s true.
‘Indeed? - my Eugene’s now thinking, - But is it true?..
And that... but afterwards you’ll know, Is not it true?
From early times he was dissembling, Some hidden hope he could leave,
On their foreheads words of Hades: Forever hopes you must leave...
Marmontel’s volume them he gave.
To Eugene sent his hearty greetings: Some hints on nearness he gave.
And to the same and strict revealer, To neighbourhood occasions gave.
To tiresome this drive, all failing, An hour or two they gave;
At first I wished to keep it secret; Believe me: never of my shame You’d guess, as I would well behave
But Lensky, having no wishes Of marriage ties the weight to have,
Indeed she now could behave Indifferently, could be brave?
But I, it may be, not adoring Will see the secrets of the grave,
And much the more it’s nice in silence For him prepare honest grave,
My dear God, you bless and save!
But l forsee some more of bounds: The honour of my land to save,
He pined away, he was dissuading, Was dull and jealous, made believe;
He’s hiking. Never, I believe, He has been bothered that I grieve.
What for to grieve?
You make my sleepy heart revive, To my good nook more often dive.
CHAPTER FIVE
And then I shall begin to rhyme New couplets, more than twenty five,
A mere hit from all I’d give.
You, constant vivid job, could harden My slender force, to me could give
Do comme il faut… (Shishkov, forgive; can’t some good translation give).
Forgive!
Arid thus we now part, forgive!
My travelling mate, I beg your pardon; My true ideal, you forgive!
The almanacs and all the journals In which to us they lectures give,
And wondered: would he be alive?’
Can share stillness of pastimes; Long live
To her was due first dream unquiet Of poet: at love the drive,
Which’s shiny, windy and alive, But selfish, idle, thirsts for thrive.
For what and where do I strive?
Uneasily she was expressing Her thoughts in mother tongue expressive;
In shade of old trees protective, He was in games her mate effective.
But if the morals never shifted, My love to ballets could survive.
Her real doubt Zadeka never could resolve!
You help my doubts to resolve:
But can’t you really absolve Her passions, if you them revolve?
With joy he knew: for wedding carriage Two weeks ahead was fixed above.
On earth, then might be by her love She’d joined the friends the day above!
-Ah, dear my! in my teenager We heard yet nothing of the love,
Enticing goblet for my love, Its you, who made me drunk with love,
Ah, he could love; they don’t now Have anything like real love
Of poet, who’s anyhow Convicted to the truthful love:
And I’ll remind the speech of passion, The words of longing, wistful love
About girls, you meant above, And how did you fall in love?
Fille était fille, elle était amourese. She was a girl She was in love.
But whom to love?
Or otherwise I’d be with rages By all my kin pursued for love.-
If you could know, what’s diminished To languish in the thirst for love,
Or on the lyre draws a dove With pens and paints, with all his love;
Of humble girl some secret love?
The secrets of the bed of marriage, The garlands of the sweetest love
My hearty friend, my friend beloved, You come, I’m husband yours by love!"
By thoughts of her each one another Unfavourably try to daze;
His wit of poet was milding; His constantly inspired faze, -
I dread: in my submissive prayers You’ll see by strict, severe gaze
Could give a fright by desperation, With flattery could draw one’s gaze,
The modern taste of his attire, To keep your curious gaze,
His misty, foggy gaze
From archives coining several youngsters In throng at Tanya stiffly gaze,
His ardent talk was full of haze;
Some scornful, cunning, idle ventures, - Your angry blame I grasp in haze.
He real bard resented there, When all alone, lost in haze,
Is she the same Tatyana real? To whom he privately, in haze,
Were lilted with passions, lazy fidgets, With dreams of thoughtful soul’s haze.
Of many kin suspicious gaze, Of husbands friendship’s heavy haze?
Like Harold Child Onegin’s fallen Into the thoughtful lazy haze:
And to Onegin with wry smile From poet he gives for reading A leaf.
He knew the Latin anyhow: To talk about epigraf,
Zarétsky, brawler; they believe: Of gambling gang he was the chief,
And nothing cooled his strong belief:
To comfort sorrow and grief.
And you, ‘Bordeaux’ you came friendly, Like friend in trouble and in grief,
The tracks of tears; in a chair In front of heroine in grief
For him two hearts, I can believe, Yet are in grief...
And quickly both they yet off
At home did he shut himself And yawning, tried to write of self.
And then he dressed himself...
Each one by nature is restricted By contradictions in himself.
Whose author bolter nature’s feeling Than Chateaubriand does himself.
Onegin’s out by himself, He goes to redress himself.
By those phantoms he, vain seeker, Should not in vain exhaust himself:
Alone with his soul’s self Unsatisfied was by himself.
To write about otherself As if about ownself?
Who’s always proud of himself, Of dinner and of wife herself.
But he’s forgotten, and to other His bride has given all herself...
Sometimes to Olga he is reading With morals novel for herself,
Has breathed, has wailed; from nothern shelf Enchanting winter comes herself.
Let’s visit them; you’ll be obliging: Or otherwise you judge yourself:
Delights it glorifies itself, Without love it revels self.
To Lensky speaking of himself, Revealing all his heart itself,
And happy rights for own self Like haughty Moscow itself.
Well, she had found charming secret In sense of horror by itself:
My bad translation incomplete. Its like of picture poor copy; Or like of
Of course, for times you have been seeing A country maiden’s album big,
‘But who? plump general that big?’
Like Harold, Quaker will he fit? Like hypocrite or other fig?
Who left Tambóv without hindrance, He wears glasses, brown wig.
Which by the girl-friends had been scribbling From start, from end in any twig.
It’s both harmful and absorbing.
Sincerely, in grief embracing
And several minutes after that With her the waltz again he’s dancing.
A mill is squatting in the dancing, By wings it crackles, flaps, is glancing.
Himself should show as the hard Without prejudices heading
But nowadays... explain the gist; To feet of mine what is you leading?
All wine from goblet at his hand Was not till end life’s novel reading,
At first of them she didn’t think, But their choice seemed queer thing, And she was lost in their reading,
With ranks of books his shelf fulfilling, For long he eagerly was reading,
The veil on hat she turns away, And superficially is reading
Alone’s sitting, pale and thin, She is some letter now reading,
The fire-place is fading...
Of loos, friends and lover-maids The voice is fading.
In great confusion she is hastening, While falling star yet isn’t fading,
Aid he awoke; they are bringing A letter: him prince N. is bidding
Of sense precautions never heeding, To her glass porch too close speeding,
At fire-place the table’s lain: Onegin’s waiting - Lensky’s speeding
Sees no use (and not in vain). But hearty pain to be abiding
In sunny rays all sparkling, shining A block of snow hardly sliding.
Imagine: I’m alone, thus From no man have understanding...
To queer dreams did not abandon, From mob apart was never standing,
He trembles... to princess he’s coming; His Tanya lone he is finding_
He rules her, but neglectly gliding, And, bending, whispers her his finding:
And everywhere finds some mark... But none relief she is yet finding
You came two times, but then of self You don’t make them yet reminding
Or with the nature just reviving We close in, confused by minding
Mazurka’s sounding.
He didn’t want to cheat meanwile The trusting heart of pure being.
Her soul managed to engage; And near him Tatyana seeing
Grey-haired couple of Scotinin With all the children you’d be seeing
If she’s seeing
With more bow can be meeting, Sometimes at all him isn’t seeing;
In snow-drifts in front of maiden A stream is boiling, all is raging,
What roses, you can be judging,
The jumps, moustache, the clicks of heels Are all the same without changing
Of that two words I must be speaking: Of young my friend I’m now singing,
Just He! His gaze on her he’s fixing, Like dreadful shade for her he’s reaching,
This way my Eugene was her teaching.
Then sudden caper - and she fleets Like down from Eolus marching,
To protests of soul’s voice, Suppressed his yawning by his laughing.
The languid wit forever smiles; The heart is still, its never dashing,
Automedones all are dashing Untiring are troikas flashing.
As well as poor moth is blending And shines like rainbowed a thing
Her letter of unwitting kind By love of innocence is breathing.
Together go and with him To take the box with fighting thing.
He looks, he calls him - all’s for nothing!
I cannot show to the end As I must go after speaking
At you in village have a weak But look. To listen to your speaking,
Is heard; the dwelling all is shaking...
In horror Tanya is awaking...
A stream Like silver shines. And after dream By hornlet peasants have been waking.
With lyre, while abroad residing, In Goethe’s, Shiner’s places hiking,
The clock’s been striking
With dangerous book alone’s hiking, In it reveals she so striking
Two neighbours, home have been walking And all about her are talking.
Arid though ladies can be talking Of Say and Bentham at the walking,
And comes to bouieward quite forlone: He there at a space is walking
That was the way of Eugene’s thinking.
In fear shameful heart is sinking.
And who, d’you think, from it is looking?
The more to light the darkness fits. In vain for fields she’s now looking:
But then with books she could be dealing.
‘Ah, nanny, that is quite (mother, I’m never bothered by your wit; I speak of letter, you should fit For that Onegin’ -Well done dealing.
To silent room of bard, alarms And wakens Lensky by appealing:
When him a schoolboy clips the wing, Or like a little hare’s trembling
Her breast as yet is greatly trembling,
Tatyana looks but isn't. soon To this world’s fuss she’s hatred feeling.
Tatyana’s now trembling, seeing By what a thought, a note, feeling
A trice ago was he living And his young heart was full of feeling,
Her father was good-humoured being, From age retarted. Scornful feeling
Onegin’s pining, feels a smart, He seems to be consumption feeling.
Who pleased her soul and the mind, Much more was touching all her feeling:
Ah, dear, all my inner feeling
- All they are yet feeling
Onegin’s soul always tries Unwittingly to show feeling
For me your honour is the bail, I trust you bravely all my feeling...
(Still previous happiness was feeling) To see my Moscow just kneeling
Surprises deeply all his reeling?
I’ve been deprived of that; I race, At hazard after you I’m dangling:
All heads are now grandly shaking The neighbours whisper (they are wailing):
To Lensky he could listen smiling.
At last before the dawn of morning His tired head on table’s falling
In it, in spite of rules of spelling Excessive verse, as they are telling,
At last he gave it up, and failing, Himself he found at her dwelling.
Onegin quickly recognized The talk of love, which was fulfilling
In front of you with signs of death Is stiffening slowly, is cooling,
In fear I was crying, darling,
Her young and dear, pretty, charming, Her confidante, her near darling
With autumn skies were dayly breathing, Not every day the sun was gleaming,
Of what the secret book, she hid, In daughter’s bed till day was dreaming
About what she’s now dreaming?
That gets away of cheecks the flaming.
Too long the silence’s now seeming...
For her the truthful sign it was That guests are coming.
The Christmas tide for joy is coming!
They laugh; the guests are now coming.
What languid is her gaze guile charming:
The storm has breathed; his prime such charming
Some poet from ranks of army Signed verse of villaine, though charming.
Of other, old, better spring, And all the heart it is alarming
To make your dear magic tuning Of beauty’s passion mood, resuming
Who hates the moving and the word When you translate him their meaning;
His nets for them were so frightening!
Or where Thalia’s stilly dreaming To friendly claps yet isn’t listening;
That recently I was you christening?’
You don’t want? - check up your cost, Or grudge, or drink, and thus the evening
The end of life; of loss confess With no hopes for regaining:
With threat Onegin raised his hand And wildly with his eyes is shining;
He shouts: ‘Stop your own crying And croaking the same, and whining,
I love you (why should I be cunning?).
He saw in it some dreadful harm; The other smiled, but smile was cunning;
All barking, dogs to her are running.
A brave sledge-cart from field’s returning, It’s fluffy furrows upturning,
Meanwhile the moon was brightly shining, By languid light it was enlightning
A nightingale in haze of night His loud melodies is tuning.
But why, Onegin, you are yawning? -
And what’s Onegin doing?
Triquet gets up; the whole meeting The deepest silence now’s keeping.
D’you, Grandison in mind yet keeping?’
Of pale and foggy, sleepy moon The lazy East is yet asleeping, -
Like convict in the stocks from jail If brought to forests while he’s sleeping,
Yet someone hisses, feet are stamping, Some blow nose, cough, are clapping;
And leans on him with trembling hands; All fearful she’s shyly stepping
To brush his nails in front of him, Eloquent madcap, wasn’t grasping.
For fair of the brides her bring,
They say, you are a lone guy, In country’s stillness you are boring.
I…’ -But you are boring
Adulteries were not adonng; His friends and freindship made him boring,
Because of ache of own head. And, though staying rake adoring,
And we... with nothing can we shine, We all to see you are adoring.
An Lane’s home from the morning Is full of guests, of kin adoring:
On day the third at early morning Tatyana saw and was adoring:
Concerns of heart he was ignoring, He future hopes was adoring,
He hurries up to ring.
Congratulating Tanya dear With first success at fair ring
For him the aim of life was smart Quite puzzling riddle, much alluring,
And in a while of storm the track In soul mine will soon be ceasing,
It is predicting to my gazing Reward, which I can’t be appraising,
Let’s turn the route we now here To keep in mind of whom I sing...
And calmly edge of earth is lighting, And, sign of day, the wind is rising,
Nor makes get up without choosing.
To her they gave a little ring, An old song began to sing:
For long to hear, understand Perfections yours, all them confessing
In front of you in pangs to stand, To pale, to fade... That is the blessing?
Yet might be less fulfilled for while By foreign words without pressing,
Well, his example gives a lesson; But, goodness me, it’s quite distressing
Enjoyed by thunder of the music From tea with rum at once refusing,
Deceased was buried after meeting, The priests and guests were drinking, eating,
For him she never will he waiting; In him she always must be hating
But Hymen’s troubles, griefs of mating,
As no knowledge they had had, And dearly were deformating
Of city dandies, maidens rich To catch the eyes derisive, rating
At their fascinating signs The flaming looks of men are fleeting.
Invitations for a meeting?
What was the sequence of the meeting?
In sadness he it all was reading, At once he hurried for the meeting,
By clear smile the nature’s fitting Through dream the year’s morning meeting
She had in hand: by fire heat That hero she was meeting.
From Bade that sceptical was reading, With works of Fontanelle was meeting.
To chase the love and all at once To get agreed a secret meeting,
A word to say, and then again To think arid think, but of the same All day and night until new meeting.
He may each entrechat catcall, Or hiss Moina, Fedra greeting;
Ran up and not without fighting
To Talon’s surely he’s raiding. Kaverin there is awaiting.
For his delight were just awaiting.
At home coffee used to drink; Were poor journals for him waiting.
Already for triumph he’s waiting,
Khandra pursued him, always waiting,
His scandal talks were such backbiting!
And by the salt of worlds backbiting
A passionate epistle’s writing.
That’s why in French she’s always writing.
I prize my hours, my days: But I’m in idle boredom wasting
And then at prince she was adjusting
Whom you’d be trusting?
At last she’s very deeply sighing, From little bench is getting
I saw, Onegin, you in life. For cemetry, eternal setting
Devotion to dreams unwitting, Unimitated strange unfitting,
At clavichords he had been sitting, But only for chords was fitting;
In epigrams it. would be fitting...). But let’s return to lady sitting.
And I had found then, amazing: By their bashful, stern behaving
The noisy talks he was escaping; All their prudent talk, such raving,
Regards of them to you I’m giving.
But its magestic merry fizz Caused foolishness and some misgiving,
‘And I was gingebread you giving!’
My soul secret forms was keeping, My muse made all them once more living,
In games with doll can train for mild Decorum of the loyal living:
That Eugene and his friend Vladimir At dawn will argue their living
All yet living
And now North, all clouds driving,
By prudent talk without trite, E ternal morals, prigs surviving,
And Lei is soaring above head: And under pillow unmoving
The snow-drift at once is moving...
Of mind some vague a thought is moving...
At last he fast awakes from dream, Apart the flaps of curtain’s moving
She kept accounts; always then On Saturdays they bath were serving,
I write, and heart yet isn’t boring, The pen unwitting isn’t drawing
Above this urn, to fate submissive, A wreath mysterious could swing.
Onegin stilly her is helping And in the corner is her laying
Among his victories to thrive, And his amusements gratifying?
She all is trembling, paling, shying.
To reverence for singing that; The poet, such great but shying.
But soon to farming she began To be accustomed and relying.
Not by the post-chaise, by jade, And my Tatyana was enjoying
‘There is my crony, he said, To warm yourself you must be trying!’
To guess the windy youth is trying
A lady’s love until to-day To speak her Russian isn’t trying,
The evening darkness comes along...
Of turnpike pillars white and florid Are seen... Tverskaya gets along...
Of men, whom I can’t judge for long, As I myself to them belong.
But yet not sharing with throng Ideas, passions yours life long".
The time is fast, she must be out: For her are waiting so long
His lyre, now mute, could dare Alarm a loud peal for long,
The sweet prosperity and freedom; I read a little, sleep for long,
She hears rings of glasses, hooping Like at the funeral great, long.
For flying glory don’t long.
For how long?
She never could caress inspire For parents; it all seemed wrong.
The master’s gone God knows where, Tracks are wrong.
Or really she guessed not wrong?
Maiden’s Song
Around carriage of the young; To see them off Tatyana flung.
Or where Terpsichore one Amazes all the public young
What would you feel if by your pistol Were killed a friend such good and young
Each minute more is captivated By Olga’s beauty so young,
And being free, again	revel In girl from Venece, pretty, young,
Was his emotional speech. Black curls his shoulders could reach.
I wait: with glance when you approach Some hopes give to poor heart Or heavy dream you stop by hard Alas! deserved by me reproach.
At least regret, sincere pity, At least by sounds of the speech,
And her attires, such belating, And her belating tune of speech!
‘Ah, Eugene!’, - She is quickly running, Like shade she’s prompt, to exit’s jumping, From porch for garden through the yard She flies, to look yet back it’s hard; In short a minute she’s been racing Across the bridges and the glade, Along the forest, brook, the lake, She is the lilac bushes breaking, Through flowers she runs... in wrench Without breath she reached a bench,
With friend a pistol fight to launch, To aim at temple or at haunch.
Each year guessed for misses much: From army husbands and the march.
It’s striking ten; he’s driving out. He’s flying... now he’s at porch.
But riot at all: like long ago For poor bard is on the watch
At crumpled canopy lies next A riding switch.
At neighbour’s monument submissive He dedicated him a sigh;
In hands I have Tatyana’s letter. It’s kept by me with sacred sigh.
Of hope, enmity and love, The blood was boiling, life could laugh.
To him occurs A stubborn, rude idea though,
Her movements were unhurried, slow. Nor cool, nor talkative is, though
Arrange the pillows in bed Then give him drugs in sadness, though
But Latin’s not in fashion now. To tell the truth but frank enough,
Could me enjoy... I’ve had my fill; It is enough!
Tatyana tries to listen better To interests of the common clash;
But in the parlour all are flattered By such a trifle, banal trash;
The coachman’s on -box with lash In sheepskin coat and red sash.
If mincing cat, on stove sitting, While purring could his muzzle wash,
Among the people wise quite choicely To pass for feigned a queer. fish,
And they expressed the common wish To call him dangerous queer fish.
Annoyance, jealousy could vanish In front of eyes with clear relish,
In eastern comfort being cherished Sad northern snow to embellish.
Who carefully us can cherish?
Who helps from slander not to perish?
Her spirit longed for fatal food; Long since unbearable anguish
As object of the judging noisy, In life you’d never have a wish:
You’ll see: they all become the bosh
Distinguished: bravely to the slush From Kalmyk horse he fell in rush.
Or on the leaves for recollections, Of other signatures beneath
He curses all unbidden guests; And half alive she can’t have breath..
He’s trembling, loses fitting words, He’s happy, has improved his health,
The spring to country all you calls, The time of work, of fruits, of warmth,
The heat of hearts became all cool; Besides we were awaited both
And so grew they old both.
My friend Elvina! Nothing hinders To love it under table cloth,
Onegin had that room for living, In which his uncle lived on earth:
Alone to my nurse, who’s being My old friend from youth and forth.
Was pedant, judging of the cloth, We’ll call him dandy for the forth.
Again his time Onegin counts, Again the day is dragging forth;
With short a word or with a cross, With question sign and so forth.
In own dreams all’s being lost For long Tatyana goes forth.
Then they estimated Each one another; daily forth
With waves I wished myself somehow To touch her dear feet by mouth.
Annoyance? bustle? or anew Some love - the trouble of the youth?

Let me look back.
At home he took out pistols To check them up, then put them back
But if the age is late and fruitless At natural turn of life for rack,
Her face but has of wrath a track...
Of music roar, of candles gleaming, The flash, the whirl of couples quick,
To barrels go bullets hiding; First time is clicking pistol’s cock.
The pistols all are now shining, The hammer’s jingling at the lock,
Meanwhile with cold sham to dare To force the speech and look with mock
For intricate and slander talk, In checking all my traits for mock,
But as a whole their talk Is harmless, but unpleasant mock.
And who inspired touching talk Which looks like madman’s hearty mock.
To play by her untwisted lock, To kiss the edge of Olga’s frock.
To what a storm of sudden sensing At heart he now has to duck!
My Eugene’s standing As if by thunder has been struck,
If I had any hope rigid Not often, mere once a week,
‘But all the elegies are mere A trifle, aimless idle talk,
To walk?
Or, as before, he plays the crank?
Her husband’s love to wife was hearty, Her deeds he took for mere crank,
Of multiplied his own crank.
And she to empty house went In which had lived the novel’s crank.
At Tanya tries to be impressing My unreclaimed yet now crank.
To trust his wife he was light-hearted, In dressing-gown ate and drank.
The frost is sparkling, we are glad To everyone of winter prank.
He now leaves the noisy rout. He goes home, has to think;
Yet long ago did I look For words in Academic Book.
To conic again to have a look And there lone read some book.
For my mistakes in Russian grammar, - Help God to find in all this book
In one he saw of brandies order, In other found debit book,
She doesn’t see yet any party Which could be helpful in the hook.
In it a friend of joys quite virgin Could bless the sky if cast a look.
Somehow, Without prefaces, just now, For hero of my book Let me attract attentive look:
His morbid and quite dying look,
For greetings and congratulations She gives each one her thankful look.
‘Left side?.. but where? what is there?’ I ‘It doesn’t matter, but you look,
The hamlet, where Eugene’s boring, Is nice and cosy a nook,
To country, people in the groves, To isolated dear nook
As at the reason of the parting Tatyana’s grumbling at the brook,
Among the hills in semicircle Well go there where brook
Two pines accreted by one root, Beneath are streaming snakes of brook
Through grass is snaking, green and purple, Through linden trees for river’s crook.
And own pawn with own rook Distracted Lensky there took,
The evening sky’s more dark.
Its dark.
Sometimes are troubling wit and heart: Without printing pretty mark
Like shade she aimlessly is hiking And comes into deserted park...
Where are of stormy love his itchings, The thirst for knowledge and for work,
You now bless long years’ work
Into the box; he now bristles; Undressed, he took some Shiller’s work.
L

But all the youngsters, always flaming, Could never enmity conceal,
Would bore, eat, drink, be ill, he fat, At last in own bed ideal
Of them some queer clown dismal Her found almost ideal
Its time! - I everyday appeal.
But simply I to you will send The legends of the Russian real
The sadness, gladness, love inflaming They all were ready to reveal.
The depth of mist can it conceal, Of fate right law will it reveal
With all my soul being sure That any rubbish, done with zeal,
In which they all are cursing me; Some kinds of madrigals, not oral,
Well have the music regimental!
He came, What news, such sentimental!
Entreaties and confessions making, To speak of anything I feel,
At sea I wait for better season, The sails of ships I call, I feel,
Meanwhile small foot in hands l feel;
He hurries up to live, As well as he does to feel.
She feels herself like all her dear Of books beloved main persons feel:
Induce to have a stop, inviting In front of their charms to kneel.
Are blessed the troubles of the day, Is blessed the darkness of the gravel
Sometimes she’s talkative or dumb, In secret gondola I’ll travel
First time appeared at the rim Of outlines of my free novel.
By night’s benevolent light breathing We mutely reveled and could fail!
Of all the charming for the bail And would be happy... till I fail!
While she’s by tinsel gown waving In front of her some throng to hail;
He doesn’t go, ready now To write to ancestors: to hail
And many pages yet are keeping Some sharpened markings by the nail;
In front of tenderness quite plain, In front of soul playful, frail...
But where of Melpomen heavy Resounds fine and drawling wail,
Like victim under charming veil.
And he returned just to the hall Like Chatsky: from the ship for ball.
I’d like to use the Alban’s model: In Petersburg to show ball.
It’s true, that all we live in ages, When rather boring is high call.
It serves him right: to think if strictly, If secret judge for him to call,
Is being deaf and dumb at all To sad and desperate your call?
Of younger beauties generation Will follow the journal’s call:
You listen to my grievous call:
Arise and ripen, then will fall, And others after them come all,
Are you the same, or others dared To change, replace you there all?
His genius was unique, alone, He knew of something best of all,
But send your boy, and first of all’ .
Her summer shoes quite wet through all; Then she her handkerchief lets fall.
It’s in the backwoods and it all Is bound by the snow-fall,
The snowflakes are flashing, whirl, Like stars at river’s banks they fall.
As he indifferently could yawn Inside antique or modern hall.
Was not astonished at the dawn To see him coining to his hall;
Importantly repeats for doll The mother’s lessons, though small.
He mutely bowed to the girl, His gaze somehow was in all
About Lensky’s wedding all Were sure neighbours once for all.
At own billiard with two balls He played from morning one for all.
The rest all gathered at the hail: Of ball the beuaty shines for all.
Described for us the snowfall, {l5} The winter’s bliss and tinges all:
For theatre Onegin’s speeding. In it each man is free at all:
To tell you all, what he had known, I haven’t any time at all.
They call, And no reason, even gappy, You have for not to come at all.-
About news and fashions dear With dolls she didn’t talk at all,
Such acts insulted neighbours all, They stopped to come to him at all.
He was to blame at times more thickly: At first, he wasn’t right at all
But you are pale... What are you feeling? ‘It’s nothing, nanny, not at all.
And flitting quickly snow-storm Is shining, whirling. But at all
But suddenly was changed it all:
At the beginning of my novel — (In chapter first you look it all)
The jams, eternal talk of all: Of rain, of flax, of horses’ stall…’
The first he made - he left you all;
Healthy all...
For long Tatyana here goes At stylish fascinating cell.
Is flying from the waxy cell.
I’m sorry that you go… well, My dear Lensky, will you tell,
To challenge you could try like hell? But in your soul can you tell
Fare thee well, and if for ever 							Still for ever, fare thee well.
But Eugene was beyond conception: Of course, he knew the people well,
A bee to fields, of tribute well,
Will pass away more fast, they tell, And you will pass the winter well.
She went and went.., All of a sudden Sees manor-house from a hill,
Much longer now she is hiking, But now brook and now hill
Behind the mill.
The sledge for race is now ready, In it he’s flying to the mill;
Like in a dreadful misty dream Against each other in the still
The waters Are still.
By deep embarrassment fulfilled She has to stop, she’s standing still.
You alone Among anxieties in still
It all is still.
Clarissa, Julie and Delphina; Tatyana in the forest’s still
Of puffing to my face the spring In bosom of the country’s still!
As I to loose my freedom feared Which’s hateful to my own will.
Yet being child, at any year Tatyana didn’t play with doll;
Of interest she is now full And tries herself the door to pull…
Sometimes himself, not as a rule, Could he entrapped like real fool;
Well, may he all it is by now The fraud of innocent young girl
‘But how are Tatyana, neighbours, And Olga, frisky pretty girl?’
The memory of bard, yet youthful, Will sink into oblivion truthful,
Lets attract. brave fellow To the chorus merriful,
On old prejudices harmful, Eternal secret tombs alarmful,
Opinion of the public mournful!
Which are half-funny and half-mournful,
His heart was sad, his voice was mournful.
To you I’m greatful!
Which was for him from time of childhood Like work and torment, was delightful,
Now spiteful, Like in vendetta they are frightful,
Of common thinking, somewhat thoughtful,
‘Ah, poor Yorick, said he, joyful
No should disarm him long ago, That young a soul.
You see, your Larina is plain, But very dear old soul;
Its worth of fine and charming soul,
With clear soul
The doubts all confused her soul:

May be, the thought to us is coming Amid poetical a dream
And where everything’s at freedom? The same yet girl... or its a dream?
I saw myself in cherished dream
And slowly through fields she’s riding, Immersed is deeply in the dream:
But Tanya now like in dream
And now sullen, now harmful Ideas trouble late his dream.
In noise of world and in the still Disturb my soul’s quiet dream.
And magic poison of its itches; You are pursued by happy dream,
Of tortures full, her heart refuges The hopes of her heavy dream.
Since young Tatyana at some hovel With Eugene, in my hazy dream,
Some boys In boat with its oars rowed Along the sleepy Neva’s stream,
But now radiant moon’s ray Is dying out, and some quaky From earth gets out steam.
That’s what I am.
I — It sparkles by Hippocrene’s role, It was by own play and foam
And smelling dead the horses snort And struggle; they with white wet loam
With reason I remembered them.
Of passions press at last escaping, Again Onegin said of them
But Eugene all the lawsuits hated With lot contented, gave all them
And thus... But what a fool I am I They call you: come next week to them.-
Or when a worm disdained and deadly Is growing out lily’s stem
Princess, undone yet before him
Through tears never seeing him,
Sometimes, when he’s in bed yet sleeping, Some papers they are bringing him.
And falsely sings, Applauds and crying Are greeting him.
And impulses of virgin dream, And grand simplicity in him.
He offers necessary service And dressing-gown puts on him.
Ah, Olga gave the word to him,
My God! what thoughts could come to him!’
Of old Kremlin keys to give; But didn’t come at all to him
Without breath, with timid feeling Tatyana listened then to him.
Tatyana silently curl lean, Her languid head she bent to him;
And in his own study silent Remembered times, when after him
Alter him
You sigh not speaking of your will: When will the devil come for him!’
Three houses will wait for him.
And thus my hero grin; At minute, difficult for him,
That she, delightless in the near, Is daily waiting just for him;
Princess is staring at him...
- But why you so indisposed Are speaking bad about him?
From bed Onegin wasn’t moving, The dream yet flies about him.
And trembling state is seen by him; All vexed, he’s being in a whim.
What a whim...
Because we restlessly disclose Defects; are bustling; judge the whim?
As sign of friendship’s written in, Continued, lessened for the whim.
What’s he? is real imitation From Moscow a spook or whim
He’s blessed... But may be she has been Amused by other, not by him.
He did believe, that soul dear Will join enevitably him,
But somewhat pale and rather thin, And yet she’s looking rather slim;
I do remember them; in dream They trouble all my heart, such grim.
Rousseau (I’d say as if bypassing), Of how dared pompous Grim
The Gulnare’s singer imitating Across this Hellespont could swim:
On reddish paws a goose, such heavy, To get to waters wants to swim:
He was beloved.., at least was grateful To have such hope like a balm.
A hundred times is blessed, who’s faithful. Who’s got his wit to be quite calm,
Without me his time will come, But now let him live in calm
The snow’s rose shining charm; On Christmas evenings hazy calm.
In country’s place the man of wisdom, He gave his serfs a piece of freedom:
But will it come, my day of freedom?
The same I was in time of wisdom,
The same yet girl, whom he in whim Neglected then like meek for wisdom?
They all kibitkas brim-full load. All men and women raise a boom.
Like young Lenore under noon With me was riding like a loom.
As well as bees from tasty house With noise are flying for the bloom
Possesses half of world existing Much longer, in the softened loom
In stillness of the humble grove Of innocence some charming loom,
They harness them in sleighs for road. The breakfast’s ready in the room.
The driven chairs noise arouse; All throng has rushed to anter-room
Reminiscence of old time, Of maiden’s room!
And here is the banns room.
She was him asking: For long he's here? Where from?
For that a neighbour in his farming Was puffing up: to his big farm
To whom my vice is not a harm?
He had of books, as no harm In them he saw, but no charm
But saw: annui, the rave, the harm, The fraud; nor shame, nor sense, nor charm;
Who never bores us by his charm?
And I’m afraid: in spite of charm That water brings me much of harm...
When well have cooled the passions temper And no more they would alarm
Or can he see forgotten foes, Some cravens, slanderers, a swarm
Lord Byron with his whim successful Enveloped fussy egoism In hopeless romanticism.
Forgive, secluded my asylum!
As quick as can
For epigrams was always greedy With everything quite cross a Dan;
And sheds of tears stilly stream, Her cheek on hand she has to lean.
And you have right to it, not duties, Among rebellious storms, I mean,
By cunning husband he was greeted, Of Faublas previous a fan;
Of bold children’s secret meetings That near lime at brook began.
To-day they wish to make each lady To read in Russian.
Will never tremble their hand To beat the slander off a man;
Of whom they spoke till the end: N.N. is excellent a man.
The hawkers walk, gets up the salesman, Is dragging to cabstand a cabman,
On table Eugene found then For funeral prepared man.
In them I’ll write of simple speeches Of dad, of uncle, old man:
Whose grateful, feeling, truthful hand Will pat the fame of old man!
His wig yet smoothing by his hand Of her inquires old man.
-it’s right, but may be you will show The pipe, the dagger and the man;
And you agree, my dear reader: This time like real gentleman
Is spoiled by old duels fan, He’s evil, gossip, talking man...
And fugitive of world and people, For stylish beauties stylish man,
With dear Tanya he was eager Himself to show honest man,
Some days was crying, then was trying To get divorce from newly man;
To call Anisya children go, To take the keys from porch they ran;
A simple maiden
Some grove, hamlet under hill, Behind the river sees a garden;
Enough... and has been done the burden:
Behind accacias, bird cherries From storms is hidden in his den,
What for yet here has he been?
Where we have never been.
And always turned, from us - I mean. That their looks give rise for spleen.
Like tiresome a rank of ghosts, In face has loftiness or spleen?
Some meadows and fields extended; Somewhere villages were seen,
Well, I saluted classicism! It’s late, but preface has been seen.
My Vanny Was younger, than myself I mean, And I was, dear, yet thirteen.
Of girls, which never had that sin As they are only thirteen?
But all the same, the hope them With baby-talk is lying then.
To them He paid his all attention then.
Ah, many friends were near then!
Or Baratinsky with his pen,- Let be you birnt by thunder then!
The head of Chaldean wise men, — Of dreams the fortune-teller then.
Nor tubes of stylish expert-men From stalls and boxes ever then.
By spite of fortune and of mean, While both were beginners then.
A pedant but of science man. He had a happy talent then:
- Not, then!
He quickly sleepy was from them, And grasped all clearly by then:
Has fallen…
She was the works in fields observing, She salted mushrooms, punished men,
To me I met sometimes in them! E sempre bene, gentlemen! (37)
You write the odes, gentlemen,
And whispered her each one of them: ‘You look left side at those men…’
With Lea, that’s given him too sweety; With ladies’ flatness; tunes of men;
Is time: all good but lazy-bone Epicurean wise all men,
Across the pits the sleigh is speeding, Is passing by the stalls, the women,
Around ladies dark a frame Of gaping, like at pictures, men.
But often passions were invading The mind of hermits, of my men.
‘Whith Olga what could happen?
Unwittingly in mirror’s peeping Ashamed to recognize: he’s beaten;
Onegin is deep sleep just having; The sun is now high in heaven,
CHAPTER SEVEN
And got to neighbours in a while. At once they heartily were given
In France of cooking highest gauge; And pie train Strassburg, freshly driven,
-Let’s go.- They were quietly driven,
The balconies; with lions gate, While on the crosses jackdaws reign.
Who has ideas and is living, He looks at people with disdain,
I dread to read again...
To her it all seemed rather queer, She all forgot, replaced again
The halls enormous is all then trembled, The parquet’s cracks wee heard again.
And Tanya hides her agitation, But yet she’s sighing once again
In letters though he again
Or village house - at the pane Is sitting she.., and she again!,.
By Olga’s hand the tea’s been pouring To little cup of guest adoring By dark and sweetly scenting stream; A boy already brings the cream; At window Tatyana’s standing, She’s breathing at the cooling glass And lost in thought quite deep and vast With pretty finger she is melting On misted window’s cool pane Her pattern O.E. again.
Like prisoner from any chain Is ready to escape again,
And then was speaking of the same: Of Olga, dear love, again!
She kept her manners quite the same, Was quiet bow her again.
Unmoving, lone he’s again.
Alas! I must repeat again:
But when to country comes the evening The billiard, cues are left again,
For hopes; then misunderstanding Well use to break the heart; again
At early morning comes for meeting With lone canopy again.
At twenty dandy was with brain, At thirty married was with gain,
Because she’s innocent and plain,
In shade of two pine-trees quite old; Inscription can to you explain:
Have been decayed in nature’s train Like leaves in autumn, full of rain.
It in strain
A menu hangs for order’s sake And teases appetite in vain.
Some youthful lover ran again Behind the fuss, but all in vain.
With pride for recent fame can glow: Napoleon waited but in vain
Came in.
At brook the monument is seeing She’s drawing made of leather rein,
Onegin.
And suddenly my Lensky enters, With hire Onegin.
Tatyana’s letter to Onegin.
What’s my Onegin?
His servant Guillot from France, is running in,
And into sweet and sinless dream By soul he was getting in.
Onegin no love could hook in, But listened with a pompous look-in
But then, the love of tender beauties More trusty is than friendship, kin,
Presents his friend and distant kin.
The monument in words explains Submissive sinner, Dimitry Larin,
And then I thought: He’s now in;
And christened world will have the will To build per station own inn.
(For him to hide was very easy By riding stallion from the Don,
New Regulus (of honour God) Anew he could the bonds abandon:
All fancy goods for whims abundant Which are supplied by busy London
He’s now languished by remorse, He’s being ready to beg pardon,
Before the fight to be invited... At watch, the sun he’s looking on...
Meanwhile he’s dressed for walk at morning, His bolivar he’s having on	{3]
What is your name? - He’s looking on, At last he answers: - Aghaphon…
Are kissing, tenderly press hands, They flop her curls up to the fashion,
But blessed by God of inspiration Another one in. rhymes of fashion.
But was delayed for short a while As they had no rings of fashion.
He didn’t want by any way But by the rules of artful fashion,
New generations by some reason, At secret will of great provision
And secrets of her own heart, Her sacred tears, happy tension
Because her love is not of fashion, Obedient to the call of passion?
He looked for girls without passion And left them all with none compassion,
Nor sharpness, nor some sign of mind, Nor of communal life succession;
Then for the babbles due concession To hear of her heart confession
His wish to sacrifice his fate; But for the end (to make impression)
That on the days I meant above, At feet of ladies fox expression
But Nazon was by world denied And suffered past rebellious session:
Onegin at the first admission To agent of such secret mission
As real expert does by chance. He could be silent in discussion,
Onegin’s fixing eyes upon; Where are compassions, perturbation?
Of partings, jealous indignation, Of tears of conciliation;
He left with real consolation Of woods and valleys isolation,
I can foresee: you’ll be abused By sad and secret explanation.
All those changes. All the more He, full of jealous indignation,
And works again imagination. Again her touch of fascination
And you, my youthful inspiration, Disturb my weak imagination,
Unwittingly, you see, the lives Confuse yet me with incarnation;
My Moscow... in this lunation
For you the glory and the laud, The father’s land, incarceration?
To touch in splendid admiration.
Where’s agitation And honourable aspiration
Great charm to any conversation.
In Harold cloak, hat with brim, Or other whims interpretation?
And then departures for the way, But asks before for invitation
Grandfathers to the tombs do press, It comes, the time of exitation,
But in a while I had been used To caustic, hot argumentation,
He thought: a fool would trouble his Such quickly fading high affection,
But he at real field of action Himself white raptured by affection
To grammar will subdue us all, To verse will pay too much attention:
For thoughtful singing with attention?’
Some other now drew attention, Some other managed with invention
In general he gave them hell, But any rule has some exception:
All envied by the hard, yet living! In worldly storms - of life oblivion,
At first they’d nothing seen In common.
Like in van Dick’s Madonna finness, Her face is round, red, she’s boon
Regret, resentment, being sorry, Some pure love to every boon,
Go on!
He liked the stillness, lone mood, The night, the stars, the round moon.
Like thoughts of simple lady’s soul, Like dreams of child, or like the moon
Lone in the room In stillness, in the light of moon
He sang of love, for love was loyal, His song was clear like the noon,
Some sweetish torture of the glory His blood excited very soon.
Byron
And what’s the reason?
If by the family best vision For instant I’d be charmed with reason,-
That instant I could trunk with reason
But hero, I’m not wrong, Could never be like Grandison.
And Vertcr, that rebellious martyr, Unimitable Grandison
What Grandison? Ah, Grandison!
In proud, touching inflammation Is blushing crimson.
Its true, he is unknown version, But really he's honest person!’
Or kind of madcap; sad a version Of some Satanic ugly person,
If their district visits on?
When we shall gather under banner Of stillness, rational and cairn,
He, might be, for the world’s welfare Or even for the fame was born;
Are snow-bound by the storm. In depth of snow are forlorn.
On table’s hissing yet, forlorn...
From everything to me legated, I had my heart for ever torn;
If that Fillidae you can show, The subject for the pen to mourn,
The fate and life in their turn To their judgement could return.
‘Shall go forth or should return?..
And is it true, it can’t return?
I’ll take a look and then turn’,
Was languishing and taciturn, Eloquent ardently in turn;
And am I soon at thirties turn?
And didn’t frighten anyone By natural vividness and fun,
By bondage Lensky’s fascinated, Gave up his soul to the fun.
He joked in a funny manner, Could fool an idiot for fun,
In open light dress comes out, At moon her mirror’s aiming down,
In thoughts her face too pale he found, She often seemed to be cast down;
Are troubled house-spirit gangs; Onegin’s eyes make tire own,
She doesn’t say: ‘Let us postpone For multiplying price of own
Rooms are cold, In them some hungry but high-flown
For centures to make him known.
I’m unknown...
And I’m in family unknown...
All right, by hand unfair own
The cool debauchery was known As science of the love: its own
Did try to make of that some fun: The country’s freedom has its own
To dissipate her greatest woe	 Judicious husband had a go:
I was his friend some while ago.
Nomadic life to better know, Herself with them could wild she go,
But it is late, it’s time to go...
Or, like in fever, can he get A touch of hand, or helps to go
On steps of world the bard might go
To be with you I cannot go...
Andryushka, quicker must you go!
‘No’.
Annette; And on the last one you read so:
CHAPTER TWO
Princess Helena has for ages The same of tulle well made night cap,
To meet a student while departing, Or scholar wearing night cap.
With him my cousin first Buyánov, All fuzzy, wears peaky cap,
In them you can’t see any changes, They keep in patterns old gap:
He’s happy now just to throw On shoulders her fluffy wrap,
She runs for forest... he’s about; The flabby snow is knee-deep;
By love her grief to lull to sleep, Some uhlan could her flattered keep;
Way is endless To bed from ballet; half asleep
Tatyana poor is in heat; in bed she never falls asleep;
A need for sleep.
Yet some of weary men-servants At entrance on fur-coals sleep;
But suddenly her eyelids close, She hasitates to make a step..,
And God forbid at evening party Or after ball, at porch, on step
In slow gait, quite fast and smoothly Have come the fourth already step.
At window by books in heap, By bed with carpet, chairs, whip,
But shall I fall by shaft through pierced Or will it pass beside, will slip?
Not a word can slip
She doesn’t see that day is breaking. She sits in bed with hanging head And on her letter isn’t pressing Her well cut out round stamp.
They bark and laugh, they whistle, clap, They sing and speak, like horses stamp:
In all her charms, to steppes yet bound, I can with jealous shyness poop.
I stop!
For merry dispute he was able To be in answers dull or sharp,
All that I don’t grasp.
On saucers jam they gave, and seldom Some berry water in a jug Put on a table, and a cup.
Onegin, standing up, At window it all read up.
To it headlong in simple coach Onegin now has sped up
Some minutes they were silent both, Onegin then to her came up
is going, and when she’s trying To turn aside... is coming up
But dangerous for the maiden’s heart) Quite reddenning he’s missing up.
At usual hour stirred up, In candle’s light she’s getting up.
By instant cool is all filled up To him Onegin hurries up,
I’ve read it up:
He’s rumbling, quickly he gets up, For door he nears, ail got up.
To other things let’s make approach: For ballet we shall hurry up.
But other times in mind I bear!
Tatyana, ah, Tatyana dear!
In pocket he, as Frenchman real, Has brought for his Tatyana dear,
Each name from France by Russian name, Forgot princess Alina dear;
Each day she whispers own myths Of letter to her image dear.
And asks him stilly, sweetly sighs More tenderer than reed-pipe dear:
He’s not been seen, none word from dear;
My poets! I’d like to hear If I am right; the ladies dear
They nowhere turned to her Lornettes of jealous ladies dear
Of Russian Terpsichore’s dear
He died at hour of dinner, Bermoned by his neighbours dear,
You all my slipshod stanzas here: For recollections restless dear;
I didn’t dare to believe: Cave no start to habits dear,
And Olga’s yawning; round here She’s looking for her Lensky dear.
Enough, my dear...
The neighbour... order to your guy: Not say a word he must be ready, By no means to call my name!’… -To whom, my dear?
That he’s the head - it all is clear And Tanya has much less of fear;
You’ll fall in love once more and find… You learn to rule yourself: I fear
But then your horse will try in fear
All flows in a single gear...
They had a fasting twice a year, They liked of round swing high gear,
He slept and coffee had he here, His menager’s reports could hear,
-Just solemn odes you could hear!
All’s filled by Him, by image dear, And magic force, that she can hear,
Goodness me, it isn’t For him to hear!
When suddenly from village rear He could some droshky’s sounds hear),
Shall I again your chorus hear?
D’you hear?
Tanya, near!
He writes of all that he can hear Or see of Olga in the near,
You give a pen and paper, dear, I’ll stay in bed; make table near;
‘And happiness was not unlikely, And so near!
To have half-Russian neighbour dear; As quickly as he can appear
D’you see, in front of that small group The two, the uniforms they wear...
In early spring of every year.
Along the darkish sky is flying To scatter in the sky afar,
‘But then... or it not true?.. in desert, From fussy rumours being far,
When sees: a hunter from afar At him is looking so far,
It’s getting dark; already, shining, Is hissing evening samovar, It heats the tea-pot, brought from China; Light steam is whirling so far.
His illness never was distinguished From illness, known so far,
And in addition gave to them Collection of plain fables then, With them two Pentads, a grammar.
Like Julie’s lovers, grand Wollmar, Malek-Adel and De Linar,
Then bring to Doonya some guitar,
And when a falling shining star
-What said the satirist, remember!
To read... but thoughts yet make him wonder His heart is sad but doesn’t slumber,
The same is dog, the same’s her man Which is of club the loyal number,
You first of alt must love yourself, My dear venerable reader!
That he at love such timid, tender Last evening joked like offender;
‘I’ll be defender; I’ll not endure when offender
And young a woman, city dweller All summer in the country spender
Is cunning liric, who can render
His look was always quick and tender,
Such charming, tender.
A jug for apple juice he took, An old calendar in order:
Were full of liberty his views And soul. Ardent, somewhat queer
To part Eke friend, but real, eager.
In order that derisive reader, Or any editor, too eager
What blunder! I’m a punished ranger.
She’s not astonished, hasn’t anger...
Of Giaour, Juan famous singer, With him some more two-three might linger:
‘Of them my Olga is the younger.
And. told her:
For tears, rhymes and so on?… Present me her’.
But it’s enough to speak of her:
The men all bowed her more eager And tried to catch the eyes of her.
And when sometimes in front of her
The maidens tried to pass by quiet In front of tier through hall; and higher
The ladies tried to her to near; The old women smiled on her;
‘Lord! to her!..
And of Onegin, far from here, Her heart reminds much more to her.
The wish of heart to whisper her.
But crosses bridge; her helping her: She runs… the bear’s after her!
To answer her.
And leaning mutely on the door Is writing elegies for her,
Tatyana hadn’t any trends To play with them in any weather:
‘What slow-witted you are, nyanya!’ -I’m old, dear friend of heart, My wit is now fading, Tanya: But long ago I was smart: By word of barin’s will I’d rather…-
Of bard the memory itself Like smoke at blue sky is rather...
Away had passed his old father, Onegin was attacked by rather
The aunts are winking one to other And pushed my Tanya quickly rather,
But all his journeys and the trips, Like all in world, began to bother:
Some other...
Night sentries, far from one to other, In stillness called each one another;
‘But I’d prefer another,
‘Tanya though!’ ‘D’you know her?-
The novels were for many years Her inner life, were liked by her;
It’s time, its time to marry her!
And who would look for maiden tender In this majestic casual manner
She tried her corset tight to wear, And Russian “н” in French best manner
With blood sustained each pure hand... They’d bel.ter part in friendly manner...
All satisfied at feast by dinner The neighbours puff in room, the inner;
You now come to rooms, the inner...
And after rather tedious dinner, When I, refreshing own inner,
You listen but without anger: With time young girl will change her temper,
Of family; not married yet; A real friend, a landlord, ripper;
All have the supper.
The time of day by tea or dinner, Or supper.
What shall I do, I can’t foresee; The same she says to all but sharper:
Well dressed, she’s waiting for her chance, But came to Olga her adorer.,.
Every country eater
Of theatre strict legislator, Inconstant adorer of later
And you forgive, my freedom later!
But let me help with sacred water.
You are in heat.- - But I’m not ill Well... nanny, I’m in love, I feel.., - God bless you now, dear daughter! -
My God, a scene from novels dear...’ -And that’s my daughter...
With her he’s ever in her chamber Until the daylight turns more fainter;
It’s winter!..
‘Well, dear me, what is the matter?
It’s late, the time has gone; his letter To rue was brought; the whole matter
Where is it better?
Of Jouvenale to talk much better, To end with vale own letter,
All they utter
Her tender fingers didn’t dare To take a needle; she could never
It caught him now and for ever; But yet to kill himself he never,
Martin Zadeka then became The pet of Tanya, and forever
Prepare ruins once for ever...
My reader, well he now leaving For long, for ever.
If not... if not, let God deliver!
Field is clear In moonlight all it seems like silver.
But no answer...
She’s up at once, Like shade she’s pale, but no answer...
The day had gone, but no answer...
Without answer.
The frames were shaking, trembling there But nowadays the men, like fair
But She whom I yet don’t dare To trouble with my lyre fair,
In front of flaming fire-place Was Benedetta purring fair
Onegin’s now free from care. In fashion has he cut his hair,
In wadded jacket and kerchief The old woman with grey hair.
And drop some tears twice or thrice; They needed kvass not less than air,
Hor
He opened a door."
Of dawn the ray all crimson sparkles And Olga opens the door;
Onegin’s sitting at the board By stealth is looking at the door.
Monsieur Triquet is on the floor, In jersey, capped, not far from door.
Without purpose or a spite Would not repeat for days in error;
My disillusioned lornette, Of joy some careless spectator,
In happy heat on moral lecture By chance could give her like preceptor?
And saying so, made he dry A glass to health of dear neighbour,
CHAPTER FOUR
Amusements or for dreams a nook, Some thoughts for heart, for journal’s clamour
Let’s go, do thorn such a favour!
- To pour half-glass you do a favour...
In paper cap for each of us To open his wasistdas.
At sister Tanya isn’t looking; She lies in bed; a book she has
Good heavens! Never did she shudder! Nor sudden paleness, redness has...
It could be known by the nurse But slow-witted all she was.
Along unfinished rhymes of words No girl’s small feet and no heads.
And -now she with great attention Voluptuous novels quickly reads,
And him repentance badly nags; This inspiration often adds
To all these letters, tears, deeds...
But where now through them speeds
But she’s neglectful to the singing, To ringing voices of the maids,
The ladies sit at fire-place; You see in corners whispering maids;.
Some loss in all the song’s refrains: The song of cat is best for maids.
Remembered, though with mistakes, Two little verses of Enaid’s.
And even nonsense having joys This idle world each time avoids.
She’s stuffy here... In her dreams Transfers for life among the fields,
A monk in black by chance appears, Or quick a hare in the fields
With grievous noise became all naked, The tog was falling on the fields,
She’s getting up with rays of morning, At once she hurries to the fields
At first two days anew he drove Along secluded lone fields
And near it (when it is raining In spring on corns of near fields),
Quite badly at unknown places, Accustomed to her chamber, fields.
Its here: take it and be ‘tackling’ !) All look like silver snowy fields...
In eyes with dismal thought of brains, Arid with a book in French in hands.
By greyish Kalmyk: wears glasses And torn a coat, socks in hands;
I was taking you in hands!
‘And I your ears pulled by hands!’
The former foe of the orders, The waster, Eugene of the lands,
Again he, downcast and thoughtful, In front of dear Olga stands;
On shaky bench, and own head To Tanya’s shoulder he bends;
Polite; with sharp-clawed paw he’s rapping Her hand to offer help; she bends
She’s deaf for greetings of the friends; To hide her tears quickly bends
I had happened To know many old legends,
That there are by fate selected Of people dear sacred friends;
But when the nurse in summer gathered To Olga all her little friends,
All poets, meanwhile I’ll note, Of dreamy, pensive love are friends,
Would come together at week-ends, Unceremonious dear friends,
Submissive to the natural passion Invite to them, become her friends,
Ruslan’s, Lyudmila’s friends!
With him was always on the bends: His enemies as well as friends
Forgot the town and the friends, And boredom of the festive blends.
Who isn’t bored to be dissembling, To tell the same who never ends?
And I was proud among friends Of new she-friend with windy trends.
Among admirers obedient I’ve seen she-cranks of other kinds:
The heaven’s bodies beam and shine. The bushes, chutes without bounds
Convert the meadows to pools And bare, leafless make the woods.
Good guy and sergeant of the guards, This Grandison could play the cards.
Who father’s money never trusts To cunning friends, to crufty cards,
Admires all the noisy tightness, The flash of dresses and of words,
Some wrong and wry neglectful babble Of mispronouncing of words
He’ll never hear hymn of times, The blessing of the future tribes.
Let give the God his soul chances
She waits impatiently for feeling That hearty tremble now fades,
Arose noise at parting grades: They bring from stables eighteen jades.
Gets out, asks for own horse And rides.
But that’s more wonderful and dreadful: A crayfish on a spider rides,
And make some rainbows on snow. By lampions dotted from the sides
At goose’s neck a skull is fateful, It’s whirling round for all sides;
But now, friends, from all my sides -
He found house full of servants; To see deceased, from any sides
He aimlessly began to wander, With passions only agrees,
The panes with patterns are like marvel, By snow flocks are covered trees,
It came, it scattered, it is hanging On boughs of the oak-trees;
But nowadays the frosts are crackling (A rhyme for cra.ckling, one foresees;
The prince as if anew him sees:
For them to love yet meant to grieve, To scare males was joy for ages.
Four fatal for the life the stages...
Not seeing any use of porches Through chink she now stilly watches;
At any place you fancy him, The refuge for the happy wishes;
From glass not stopping For a while’. He never kisses hands of ladies,
Of higher world the queer ladies!
Through tight a row of the grandeurs, Of diplomats, of army dandies,
But now dear moon for us Is mere lantern in the skies.
And dreams as well as cartomancies, The moons predictions in the skies.
The snow’s crackling... someone’s near... On her tiptoe fast she flies
The waltz is whirling; noisy, taintless, A couple after couple flies.
At clear morning he is leaving, In sledge along the river flies.
The spurs of horse-guards-man are jingling, Each foot of pretty ladies flies,
Of yard boys family just flies.
Smoke From pipes to chimney flies.
Maliciously discuss with smiles: If I was sharp or dull in lies,
But aim of looks and talks on whole That time at feast are fatty pies
At her much frightened loud cries
When some respiended dear lady To give in quatro me yet tries,
By fire of the praise and sighs To tempt the heart of girl yet tries:
Nor foreign beauties so fine, Nor sciences, nor evening parties
It hurts, he laughs, through window-panes At him his mother’s finger shakes.
Sometimes allured is for days: With love the Satan jokes makes.
In haze are now minds of people: The moral them to sleep just makes;
Her grief she never hides And lone in the woods she hikes."
And semicircle wide of brides,- All that at once one’s feelings strikes.
But talk of their dear wives By absent wit him always strikes.
With fragrant, all grey-haired head An old man said old jokes,
With age to argue is unfitness; The custom’s despot of the males.
Meanwhile some two or three of pages (Some idle gibberish or fables,
Of British muse some old fables Her dreams disturb, and it enables
-In this I see yet no troubles…
Of daily troubles.
Is it because in higher circles
Ali that has gone like sound’s fizz, And dear Tanya’s youth all dwindles:
With fire in the drooping eyes, Unwittingly she slightly smiles.
He, touching witness, captivated By childish prettiness of games
Confess; we have the taste quite mere In life, as well as in the names,
When we for better education Will widen more all needed frames
Tatyana trusted legend’s fancies Of simple folk’s old times.
To show his beloved main person As perfect one for all the times,
‘Bordeaux’ all the times!
His style to pompous tune rerversing An ardent author tried sometimes
His friends arrived like vile observers Who come to funerals all times.
Slipshod result of my pastimes,
I know: Parny’s tender rhymes Make no hit at present times.
Her husband comes.
Some big and shaggy bear comes .. Tatyana: ‘Ah!’ But he becomes
But as soon as in charms of dreaming He lost himself - his neighbour comes
You take my set of florid rhymes
Was impudent and shy; sometimes Could show how tear shines,
At other kinds of lines.
Without prejudice considers The others oils but us as ones.
The foes!
Blue smoke rises to the sky, And thorough German baker goes
Why not? It’s pleasant and sonorous; With it, I know, always goes
For fantoms I my eyelids closed; But some remote dear hopes
And thus the time would pass; meanwhile They ask, and Olga tea prepares;
Be quick, my friends! the field invites. In carts with weights of food, attires,
He cast a glance at ladies’ tires, At circles but with looks, attires
‘But trouble is: they are such bores’.
But can’t: through door her Eugene enters; In front of eyes of Hades’ spectres
She doesn’t listen to the guests And curses their idle leisures,
To be Napoleon each wishes, But millions of the two-legged creatures
Do not reflect Diana’s features, Recalling bygone novel’s creatures,
I was in love with it sometimes, But soon was bored by pretty creatures.
Would come, she innocently grieves, Her languid eyes to moon she raises;
His pistol then Onegin raises
La morale est dans 					la natura des choses.
Indeed, by magnetism’s all forces The mechanism of Russian verses
The drivers all themselves incite By clapping; each his master curses...
Zhizhi, my soul’s crystal first, The subject of naive my passes,
At inner room a cry just bangs: Princess is ill in bed, but fusses.
Onegin’s coining with excuses.
Departuring date again's belated And can yet run the last of dates.
She parts with woman, house keeping, Behind the gates.
With mill Zaretsky has been dealing: Mill-stones he investigates.
By own or by post-chase You get away from city gates.
The vice, that’s gentle but not feeble, In novels now celebrates.
Philosopher among his mates With them his room he decorates.
(In times, by thorough foundation Of philosophical best rates,
Some foreign words, she often writes.
Is waiting for the end of dance, And for cotillion her invites.
The first of leaflets just can show: Qu’ecrirez-vous sur ces tablettes;
Unwittingly may bore by image Of its monotonous naked hues.
Some other, cool and cold dreams. Some other, more severe issues
Her easy dreams by other dreams; As well as trees can change the leaves
Or aren’t we glad to see returning Of perished in the autumn leaves
Oh, Brenta! I again shall see you. My dear Adriatic waves,
I keep in mind the sea, quite stormy: What envious I was when waves
Sometimes of him in midnight hazes, Untill yet Morpheus, she believes,
Some several miles from Krasnogóry, From Lensky’s village, there lives
Alas! On furrows of lives
Monotonous and sometimes yet senseless, Like whirlwind of the youthful lives,
I’d cheer up imagination By picture where love yet strives.
Or am I stranger to enjoyments, To all that gladdens and revives,
Through roar of fiddles never thrives The jealous whisper of styled wives.
In turn to girl were all returning With love to feet to lay themselves.
He, dandy in his prime, approves All Kant’s ideas and his moves.
And like with friends, for long well known, With all the meadows and groves
The portraits of the tsars on walls, And motley tiles on stoves.
Grand treaty’s ditties exercise; The foes stand and drop the eyes.
By his anwaited apparition, By instant tenderness of eyes,
By writing verse, the dismal mourner Of parents, with running eyes,
For long as if through fog she one Could follow them all with eyes...
Amusing idle gaze, all miles Are glimpsing like a fence in eyes.
Of course, Onegin’s not alone, Who saw her disarray in eyes,
All are amazed, my Lensky sighs, Does not believe his own eyes.
A plain inscription, then she tries To stop the dim in tender eyes.
But shall I see you?’ - Tanya cries And sheds the tears from her eyes.
My pen has no old wishes To spoil some useful flying leafs;
He sang of partings and of griefs, Of something, foggy misbeliefs,
She sighs, assuming as her real Delights of others and the griefs;
But in gloomy cliffs
She’s always bored by loud laughs By noise of their playful muffs.
Of known ladies feet and legs.
Who grandly tries but mere rambling To prove the people: eggs is eggs?
With all the fame of red high heels, With grand, magestic old wigs.
To take it up she can’t, in fear Of bear: he about hangs;
Severity instead of kindness; Indeed, for you was neither tidings
By happy force of own dreamings She brings to life all novel’s beings,
To Moscow, they need good things.’..,
Of lofty thoughts, of simple things.
All innocent the talkings flow; With lie they beautify some things,
Necker 					The morality is 					In the nature of things.
And there, in the shades of links, My younger days were rushing things,
My Friends, you know, what it means: With friend of mine I’ve shooting things.
Because we often take the talkings For real, useful, vital things?
Ah, you, whose memory will fuse In verse my flying feeble dealings,
(If I had right for some decisions) I would prefer to slighting feelings,
But then, amused by idle dreamings, Attended to my better feelings
Of agitated soul’s feelings
That all the best and sacred wishes,	 And all the fresh and pure dreamings
The fright of shame, of evil word? Where are you, cherished happy dreamings,
She falls on snow - he is swifty: He’s taking her in paws and brings,
Not any man can grasp such things; Ignorance many troubles brings’
Onegin got Tatyana’s message. It quickly touched his soul’s strings:
A shepherd bast gay sandal’s making, Of fishers from the Volga sings.
(At season, which is called meanwhile The time of wolf and dog for meetings,
My greetings!
That dream aroused her misgivings.
Then hoofs, wry trunks, it let alone The tufted tails, the fangs in mugs,
Upholsterers inspected, painted Renewed the old closed sleighs.
In pride they were with males indifferent. At distance stayed from praise and sighs.
And now Tanya is alone Alas! for long-time friend she sighs,
By got by Olga strange tuition She’s touched, in depth of soul sighs;
Unknown in the thick of grass To bees, to moths at no paths.
Decided is.
He’s not a fool; Onegin, grudging, Did not respect the heart of his;
With brilliant Voronskaya Nina, Of Nova Cleopatra this.
But liked the spirit of his judging, Judicious talks of that and this.
He tried his cooling word to own, To keep away from man like this;
I last and poor mite was giving For you myself, remember this;
In languish of unwitting pities Onegin quickly at her feel is...
Which doesn’t pity any things, In front of which the life yet is
And with her eyes all them adoring She looks around and she speaks:
Who’s there, crimson beret wears, With Spanish diplomat she speaks?’,
The same, from whom he now keeps A letter, where heart her speaks,
Quite mutely for herself she keeps, Of them to nobody speaks.
In all of them restriction’s queer; Antiquity the old backs.
It shows traceries affective, Informs of mind’s the secret backs.
The novelty with ages smacks.
But by your narrow small tracks,
Of tears tracks?..
Because remember bitter mourning When hear noise of forest’s thicks?
At people looks she, never smirking, Without imitating tricks…
The lanterns, children, many shops, A palace, gardens, cloisters, flocks
For pranks reproved with gentle talks, To Summer Garden took for walks.
Onegin, friend of mine for years, Was born on Neva-river’s banks.
Appear profiles of heads Of ladies and of fashion cranks.
At table each of dear guests Had course according to the ranks.
The cool of humble pride composed, Of ages medley and of ranks.
He kept me often in his hands, While I could show many pranks
May be, you saw at Neva’s banks Some ladies of these queer ranks.
The talkative my lyre’s tired To glorify all haughty ranks.
She thinks:
Some tears shed at urn my early: ‘He tell in love with me,’ to thinks
Quite charming actresses, he is An honoured cityzen of links.
This noise, the lustre and the crooks, For wild a garden, shelves of books,
In sledge he’s sitting now. -Away, away! - the driver marks,
And, covered with the frosted gown, His beaver collar now sparks.
And early ringing of the bells (Precursor of the morning works)
His own works?
Zaretsky’s bitten both lips; To Lensky Eugene then appeals:
My muse new person just reveals.
Of ill princess the joy, caresses Are touching Tanya, but she feels
With one of feet the floor she’s touching, With other slowly she wheels,
In which yet streams the clear brook, To flowers, to all the novels,
And boring pictures’ row, done In style of La Fontaine’s sweet novels.
You may become a man of business And think of beauty of the nails.
Eloquent man, by him invited, Triumphantly the answer trails.
For teeth the brushes, and for nails, Some thirty kinds for all avails.
Each box in theatre is shining, In pit each stall already boils,
But people! all you are alike Your ancestor, called Eve, foremother: What’s given, hardly it involves, But constantly the Dragon calls
On chest he puts his hand, unfortunate, And falls.
Of legislator of the halls?
At smooth of parquets in the halls, At sea on granite and at malls.
It lies like carpets, white and waving, Among the fields, around hills.
For us are only some tools, And all ones passionate are fools.
A lot of stories with the whirls, With wicked ghosts and the girls...
The Pans of the district girls, With Olga Petushkóv then whirls,
Of others victories and own The pranks, the hopes and the dreams.
In country lyre is more ringing, More vivid are creative dreams.
That time to all my childish dreams
For her cotillion now seems Like long and heavy dreadful dreams,
Indeed, he’s blessed, the lover tranquil, Who can explain his own dreams
For all his thoughts it was a passage - Unusual tongue of maiden’s dreams.
Of saint fulfilled generous dreams,
The yawnings, other cold things He never saw in any dreams.
And many verses, jokes, whims, And arguments, and merry dreams.
The ghosts of unearthly whims, Of sacred poetry dreams?
In coolness of the gloomy grove With purl and babble of still streams,
Conditionally by its charms Self-willed desires it alarms.
With unaccountable charms He sees his Olga in his arms...
To honest people he belongs: This way the century reforms!
The dreams: fir-trees, the hag, the bores, The East, the bear, snow-storms
They kept in peaceful life some customs Of dear old days; it means:
You all indifferent, lucky, prone Of Levshin school the pupils, fans,
The bear drags behind and groans; In front of them she sees and moans:
Has own place to have a rest, From porch to maiden’s.
At window alone, sad (Diana’s ray lights up, her wakens)
Instead of praise he gets yet griefs: Alone under Finnish heavens
‘Forgive me, ever peaceful valleys, Hill peaks well known under heavens,
At margins of the books she’s meeting Of reader’s pencil slightest signs:
He was a common Russian barin, Was kind and good; at his remains
Yet child, by Olga fascinated, Ignorant yet of hearty pains,
His temper, in his chair sitting, And aims to own each other’s brains;
Devoted to lazy feeling, With void in soul, he resstrains
We all were taken by the dreams, As if young life anew begins.
They were at Shrove-day accustomed To have the fattest Russian blins;
All servants gathered at the gate To part with barins.
‘And whom?’ - She’s Larin’s. -
To have remorse I haven’t forces; Like Bogdanovich’s all verses I’d like all dear gallicisrns, As well as previous youthful sins.
All us, well laugh at their impulse, At late ridiculous opinions,
They all began to guess of reasons, Invented stealthily decisions,
In songs could proudly retain For all his life exalted passions
In young sad soul’s aspirations; And yet much more with dismal passions
We’ll be like invalid in hut, Who nears ears to confessions
The first in life the stormy passions, And they give birth to new impressions,
Of trusting soul hard confessions, Of pure love such good expressions;
Of sleepless nights, of inspirations,
Of mind some cold observations,
His own tender verse he leaves Like monument to his affections,
Who listens to the same objections And bans the thoughts of wrong reflections
He hasn’t any fascinations, But has some snake of recollections,
The dreams, not bound with this day, The threats, the talkings and predictions,
The folly’s wicked, giddy, needs Grand rubbish for the grand high persons;
And he inspired her at dawns!
Some files of steel for nails, some combs, Some scissors, straight and wry: he owns
It seems to him like something awful To her remind all evening gaps.
Each claps.
But from. the shaggy lackey-bear She cannot get away, She flaps:
Of rhymes the fever: he could double Of poetry sacred scraps,
Her maiden’s mirror yet she keeps.
Mazurka now all its rating, Initiative beauties keeps:
He comforts her in all her griefs And constantly with her he sleeps.
Rather well The grove sleeps.
Tatyana steeps.
Of looking back she doesn’t dare And hurries up, she’s quickening steps,
I never wished with such a torture To kiss young Armid’s pretty lips,
But suddenly the wind has blown Away the lire of all lamps:
Or Idol mio; dropped by chance On fire journals or his pumps.
Themselves to show making booms, To gleam, to charm, to fly to troops.
A mute reproach, begging looks, - All that she grasps.
May be, you rose from the clans In those places, or have dears,
Did happen any bard in tears To deer love to read with fears
‘Well, let us go…’ Prince then nears His own wife (and she them hears),
This news Tatyana quickly hears.
And sadly shedding hitter tears To part with Olga mother nears
At foggy rivers And hills the moon just dasappears.
But jingle of the spurs he hears, Tatyana’s husband just appears,
Love-letter secrets on six sheets, The fraud, the gossip, rings, the tears,
Her way is crossing, then she feels Herself embarrased; and of tears,
The chairs, saucepans and the trunks, The matresses and jams in jars,
In crowd everybody renders:
Of waters, forests and of hands Is master in the country borders;
The time revengeful now nears, In secret Eugene gaily sneers,
Among the servants-maids-teenagers.
It happened: late at time of leisures Two girl-friends, both yet teen-agers
‘To whom in throng of jealous girls You dedicated tune of hers?’
Sometimes himself for tricks on others Was given lessons by the others;
Brothers!
At any place there are some chambers, Of damask are in rooms wallpapers,
At sea to hear for a while Of nereid unceasing whispers,
At any sides we’ll hills divide, Will dig the tunnels under waters;
My Tanya’s hugged by their daughters.
In spring at grass and so forth, At iron fire-place in winters,
From saucers, filled with clear waters Some rings get out as on trotters
Like North Aurora’s face of her, And like a butterfly she flutters.
-My hearty friend, you have some fevers.-
The nightingales, of spring the lovers, At night all sing: dog-rose flowers;
The eyes are blue as depth of heavens, The smile, the flaxen curls of hairs,
Of beauties light and fine attires, Of people variegated choirs,
-I hate your world of fashion marbles, Much more I like the world indoors,
Engaged alone with accounts; Or, taking cue like somewhat armours,
That time in sacramental valleys, At cries of swans, of spring endeavours,
Zaretsky to behave refuses: ‘But where is the second yours?’
(As well as in the old years In time of mine and time of yours),-
With narrow and long wine-glasses, Reminding slander waist of yours,
For coddled sense the best of pleasures: Perfume in bottles of cut glass.
Says yes or no, never да-с Or нет-с’(the words, they all would pass).
While people yawn in church at prayer, To find a bunch of praying grass
She doesn’t glare at the rest, And doesn’t claim to have success;
Ooh! What encirclement she has Of christening coldness, princess!
To meet princess.
Appeared-vanished quickly rather, We gee, but don’t we. confess.
Was too afraid, I must confess...
They are alone far from people, Are playing at the board of chess,
At Lensky Eugene looks quite forceless.
‘For the sake of goodness, You keep the eclog, now useless.
And I - with sighing I confess - Am dangling after her much less.
Like Byron, poet of grace. Or it’s impossible or faithless
In village, in forgotten stillness Of you I’d never know, thus I wouldn’t know tortures sleepless.
What has been moved inside of him, In soul lazy, cool, delightless?
We must all time all them caress, Respect and love at heart, not less;
For it I shall repay a lot By my admission, truly artless;
With age the life is such a badness...’
I like teenage’s lively madness, The tightness, brightness and the gladness;
At meetings but without lights, And tears, secret torment’s gladness...
And no hope!... full of sadness, He now curses own madness.
‘Sed alia temporal’ But rudeness (Like dream of love, the prank of goodness)
His lunch him answered with politeness.
Without gold can revive While simple product is its richness:
Maidens dear, beautiful, We are mates in friendliness,
He liked the grove’s timid thickness,
She opened the feasts In it And praised devices of the chillness,
But you forgive him, games in stillness!
Is sad of passions dead a track; This way the storms of autumn coolness
Was able any glimpse of sweetness, Of vergin years bias giftness
Arrival slow of the guests In front of hostess young brightness,
As well as ruddy foolish moon At the horizon’s foolish brightness’.
In actions husband’s mutilated, And us for that at court caress?
And no brow moved she rasher; She didn’t even lips her press.
Of ladies well-considered dress. I love girls feet. But it’s a stress
And now in my garden small She came at once as district mistress,
Immense and light, at distance waiting; Through glasses old people guess
But with Tatyana shan’t we guess.
Tatyana took advice of nanny; As she in bath-room had to guess
A sound sleep, the walks, the reading. The forest shade, of brooks the hiss, -
Sometimes with pretty girl a meeting, A young and fresh unwaited kiss,
‘I’m not quite made to be much happy. My soul’s alien for bliss;
Perfections yours make speech my gappy, Of them I’m not yet worthy, miss.
In duels classic, pedant cross
Of world conventions breaking load Like he I lagged behind of fuss,
The surely we may her min Among the nets of tempting fuss.
But no man in all the district Could ever know of that fuss:
She makes her figure twine and twist, With quick her foot the foot she beats.
But doesn’t lade the heat of cheeks, And brighter, strickingly it heats,
The men confront. All cross in peace. The throng, all humming, takes the seats.
She likes the order, well-composed, Of oligarchial the chats,
At. fifty who was liberated From private and from other debts,
Of words for songs of prairie districts...
At rocks of the Caucasian districts
Nor ballets, cards, nor verse one meets.
In heaps, forgotten in the streets.
In country tedium’s prevailing Without palaces or streets,
Why! out of the country thickets...’
In deserts of the heaven’s districts, The goddess of the sighs and secrets.
By sorcery of story’s secrets!
To them, to their senseless feasts She brought her fine and dear gifts,
For noise, for storms, for many feasts, For everything! For all your gifts
The one was Eugene in these deserts, Who could evaluate his gifts.
The moon, this miracle in heavens, To which we dedicated nights
The time for strolles, much inspired, And all seductive, tempting nights.
But where are you? Come! My rights
Inspired, I again shall feel you, Your magic voice for me awaits!
My Lensky on the dam is leaning, For them impatiently he waits.
By eager enmity exited Vladimir for the answer waits.
Yes! just indifferent oblivion Behind the grave for all us waits.
With what a lively fascination Deludes herself with all deceits!
At window she now sits.
Of proud ladies yet she slips, She now looks, but stilly sits,
He brought from Germany his dear, As poet, of learning fruits,
The boulevards, cossacks and the butts, Drug-stores and towers, the garments,
Triumphant is and gladly shines, Is boring me, makes suffer torments
I’m greatful for the good enjoyments, For sadness, for the pretty torments,
Apostate of wild enjoyments,
By him were left at your employments.
Whom don’t bore the falseful fears, The prayers, swears, threats and hints,
Tomb-stone is gloomy, Is lost, and last of feet the prints
You never stamped your small foot-prints. You liked smooth carperts of some prints
And she forgot the speech of gods For scant and queer lots and lots
And glory of the old starts, And panting dreams of all young hearts
Of boasting moustached young guards Who conquered pretty ladies’ hearts.
Like long before make heart my tremble And all my soul always flirts.
What does she see? that at the boards Are sitting spooks of any sorts:
But landlords of the country’s peasants Were never liked by him at feasts;
She capital forgot at distance, Its lustre, all its noisy feasts;
Through thickened crowd of the guests, Or handkerchief picks up with jests.
To-day frivolous generation Matures, stirs, already tests
And he invents by whim’s requests Caricatures of the guests.
But what Tatyana could he thinking When recognized among the guests
And like the Beccant could she gamble, With bowl sang she for the guests,
Sometimes in dream they all, whom dote, To soul mine arrived like guests:
Comes up to Olga: several jests, And they are whirling near guests.
Of Buchars, sledges, kitchen-gardens, The merchants, peasants arid the huts,
Yet does it whirl the world and us:
Derzhavin old us was greeting, To tomb descending blessed he us.
-I’m glad. - ‘but when?’ -Well, now just, They will receive with pleasure us.
But even such a friendship, readers, We haven’t now; each of us
We easily betrayed her daily And she was cheating all of us;
With many senses all this fuss, Which is antique for all of us.
The less we love a pretty woman, The easier she’s liking us,
What for you visited all us?
Its sad to think, indeed, that vainly The youth was given to all us,
With dear muse of mine capricious Let’s hear forest’s noise delicious
The horse for rider proved obedience, The dinner rather well fastidious,
At her to gaze he was assidious, But no tracks of Tanya previous
This Russian family seems light, To all the guests it’s always zealous,
Perhaps, in front of portrait famous, To people future ignoramous
Alone you, to speak my mind, I’d take as friend of days my grievous,
And Tatyana’s nervous
To see it here even poor I cannot; does it bother us?)
O , rus!
And let them God long live for us!
Can know time without fuss: The stomach is the watch for us.
The world with smile my muse was electing, The first success lent wings for us,
By worst of modes: modern fuss, Which is a tyrant for us.
We them remind about us...
His verse is sluggish and obscure (It’s called romanticism by us;
The seasons country views
Meanwhile Onegin’s stay at Larin’s Was estimated like a news,
In fruitless speeches drily fuse inquiries, some gossips, news,
To you	give with my endeavours And bows.
Are shut the shutters, limed are flirted The windows.
Some cold wind just blows.
A lot of pretty loving rot; He it declaims; the sound flows
’But may be she’s in love?’ ‘Who knows?
That she is good, dull husband knows But at has fate he curses throws,
In front of darkened silent homes, Along the sleepy streets in rows;
In them reflects the whole age And modem man of nowadays
By fate all counted my days, All painful are they nowadays,
From bed to icy bath had fallen And afterwards was whole days
You’ll find some vowes to the dear To love her until dying days.
Eight years did he kill these ways, And thus he lost of prime young days.
Enough the boredom on the ways: The journey took them seven days.
To each grandparent to show Her lazyness dispersed for days.
‘At fire-place Alone barin sat for days.
All days I spent in sleep, in shades, And there had my happiest days.
Will take the twilight of my days.
For us fine Hymen now makes And maybe yet for many days.
At Olga then he fixed his gaze And whispered: ‘I’ve my happy days...’
Who’s helpfully for us adjusting His own deeds and when he prays,
Without fail you’ll find them here: Two hearts, the blooms, the torch’s rays;
Who’s that, which never us betrays?
The woman says:
And leaf by leaf through it is looking But nothing to her sister says...
In spite of Foebus warning notes Myself I’ll humble to the prose, When novels in the old ways
Can’t wash her arms, her breast and face: Afraid she is of winter ways.
The withering of own days, Which can’t revive by any ways?
It’s dark in valleys.
And of the world new lustre, noise Fulfilled his wit with future joys.
A dwarf with tail; and there’s that Who’s half-a-crane and half-a-cat.
He speeds through Petersburg, all restless, Awoken by drums’s beat.
Alas! all days and nights are now One long and lone dream in heat,
They bring Tatyana to grand meeting The tightness, agitation, heat,
She hurries up to have a chat.
In dark my Tanya’s quite upset With nurse in whisper has a chat:
But why? I don’t grasp it yet). And now friends enjoy a chat..
Your pricks of swear, you must know, Your strict and cool severe chat
Of dear friends a pretty chat.
Then he for her a chair’s finding, They speak about this and that,
(It is the same for people simple) To curse him tried this way and that.
For all of that
With unexpected consolation Unwittingly some thought of that:
As they are mean and simple features, You won’t see fine art in that.
For weeks matchmaker was then coming To all my kin, and due to that
(Which seemed to be like this and that) Me captivating; and for that
And now at your will is rather To punish me with scorn for that.
What?
And what? -
And what?
And what?
And what.
And what?
‘But do you love, indeed, the other?’ -And what? -
She’s taciturn like that Swetlana,.. When came, at window she sat.-
But never wanted to correct; To censorship I’ll pay my debt;
But may be those kinds of pictures By now can’t you all attract,
You are guessing To know; you are quite exact:
His letter’s here, quite exact.
Of Russian works he something read, Rejecting nothing for effect;
With yawn I’ll cover disrespect And shall of bygone recollect?
He differed people in effect, And other’s passions could respect.
And in the world could help to back Seductive though small respect?
He puzzled over effect, In it could miracles suspect.
Onegin now enters, For stalls comes over the feet,
The persons, known everywhere, And wanted fools for trampling feet.
For long to wish, your knees embracing, And weeping at your dear feet,
Of sorceresses words and peep Delusive are... as their feet.
But I can hardly drag my feet,
And full of truth which he can meet His elegies like rivers fleet.
For garden now we shall fleet In which she’s got with him to meet.
With kin to meet
Her neck was caught by long a bough, Then branches could her ears meet
But many days away could get
Then supper... time to be in bed, And soon the guests all home get.
Tatyana has a dream unknown: As if she lone were to get
Of own life he could forget!
In what a waste, when? where? how? You, madman. will all them forget?
‘I weep... If that your Tanya old Till now you could not forget,
Severe anguish, called a spleen, Was seeking in the world unquiet,
In summer Eugene lived like hermit: Past six was getting up in hamlet,
And who that poor Tanya previous In this princess could not have met!
Onegin was as mute as dust, Tatyana pined for love in secret;
But blissful husband of coquette, To part from him you did regret!
Attractiveness; to catch in nets By first expressing some regret
The rime on frosty days yet sunlit; And sledges; and before the sunset
Of stylish words some ready set?
But darkish mirror can reflect The trembling moon alone yet...
Ah, feet, such small, where are you flow, What vernal plants are trampling yet?
‘You now meet...’ - And both coolly, The enemies, not aiming yet,
Too many neighbours we have had, I cannot count al! them yet.-
- Yes and no yet.
But summer’s flying quicker yet.
B By pantalones, frac, gillette - In Russian they are absent yet.
Is he a parody not yet?
My Moscow with guilty feeling; Yet neither feast and nor a gift
Because ire, truthfulness she’s swift? Because from heavens got as gift
CHAPTER EIGHT
Could never show shining passion, Nor sparks of poetic light,
Forgive me you, my dear nature; I change my world such still and light
By sight through panes at moonlight diminish, By this quite pallid feeble light,
I knew some difficult young ladies' Like winter cold, pure, light,
Shall see emotional flight?
Should I begin my freedom flight.
She spins; a friend of winter night The splinter’s crackling making light.
All double lanterns in the sight Are stretching their joyful light,
Yet, being chilled, are striking horses, Annoyed by harness; near light
Meanwhile the Cyclops of the village In front of dimmish forge’s light
The night is frosty, skies are clear, Of all the heaven’s bodies light
And fair sex like down’s slight...
All over the Neva river, When waters, being gaily light,
Opinions of the worldly might...
In languish of the loving bounds He’s spending now day and night.
And often at Taurida’s beaches She brought me in the have of night
By dreams of distant pretty side, About moon and charming night...
And my in life success at random, My stylish place, the guests till night,
Of ballet’s noises being tired, Transforming morning into night,
And often in the summer’s sphere, When clear is the sky at night
For noise of fuss such brilliant, bright.
They don’t listen to, they cry, They argue, laugh and squeak in fright.
I don’t grasp despite endeavours; You listen to (if I am right?)
Which friend of yours with smile of terror In circles decent, so right,
With utterly regretful soul, On granit leaning, straight. upright,
It’s right.
The knight of freedom and of right, In case like this he wasn’t right.
To sit with him all day and night, Not stepping out of his sight.
It’s time to leave for life the tight
One day to their isolation And for Tatyana they then bought:
As idols now to have got Or Vampire, who’s lost in thought,
Adorer of the glory, freedom, Immersed in own stormy thought,
The poet, the thoughtful dreamer Was killed by hand of friend for nought!
For her he’s looking on... for nought...
They all replaced for each of roberts; The tea’s been brought.
This thoughtful, interesting creation By travelling merchant them was brought
But it betrays with froth imprudent My stomack. I have never sought
Made all young heart to pine away, For someone did her soul wait.
‘It’s seven soon, it’s time to wake, Onegin, may be, has to wait’.
With passion and the wit to gain, For sudden tenderness to wait,
’My second? - Eugene said with passion, My friend, monsieur Guiilot, does wait.
He stepped away... he turned a bit..’-
Has mined great life-giving voice, And after funeral sad habit
‘My habit,..
And proud language’s now lit For prose postal a bit.
The greatest gossip, old cheat, The glutton, grafter, fool a bit.
With his malicious evil wit, Who boils in action for a bit.
‘My dreams and years won’t rather Return to make me new a bit,
Could grasp in idle, futile reading, Was not concerned a little bit
Quite greatly, when he made a visit, On her was fawning, you should see it!
Lornette his double slantwise renders To see all ladies to be fit,
The letter’s ready, has been fit...
Without service, wife or deed, By something to engage unfit.
I was embittered, he… unfit.
Besides, they all are so pure, Magestic, for the love unfit,
But if my wretched fate you rather Will grasp with pity little bit, You’ll never leave me such unfit.
With throng by passions deeply fusing, I brought my playful muse to fit
In front of him gay fancy’s giving His Pharaoh, and tries to fit;
For flirt she never gives a hint - For that high world is never fit.
It’s better place for passing letters fit.
Istómina’s in front of pit, With nymths she waits to make a hit.
My student’s cell; its sullen tightness At once by rays of hers was lit,
Meanwhile in life you try to revel, As much as I you take form it!
Could change his soul little bit: Some virgin fire flamed in it,
I grasp its vanity, and never Too much I was attached to it;
Who understood it wee a hit, All his attention paid to it.
Onegin’s life is somewhat sacred; And he, unfeeling, was to it
Yet Cupids, devils and the serpents Make noise and hop in front of pit;
With charms untroubled she is sweet; For long at table does she sit
Tatyana, tell: for whom is it?
-But what is it -
A yard boy’s running in the middle, He made his dog in sledge to sit
Together for a time they sit.
Will be like Melmoth? patriotic? Cosmopolite? or has he got it?
Petrarka 			Where days are cloudy and short 			A tribe was there born 			For which to die makes no hurt. (It.)
On real price of ancient treaties, On evil, good, on science fruit,
To journalists I put at mercy Of labour mine some real fruit.
Then life almighty brings the good: A pompous bloom arid costly fruit,
With Kharlikóv Panfíl and children Monsieur Triquet arrived, a wit,
Not flaming boy for fighting fit But male with honour and the wit.
His pen with love is always sighing Without coolness of the wit:
His sharp, but somewhat cooling wit.
And by degrees to sleep he’s reading His passions, thoughts, his own wit:
In days of gaiety and wishes I could at ballets lose my wit;
Her secret heat, of which she dreamt, Whose plenitude ih heart she felt.
Whose knowledge makes his heart all cool Arid him forbids to play the foolt
What happened, what a strange a dreamt
But yet she can’t.
Which they in world of London grant To speak like vulgar, (but I can’t...
And now jealouser’s triumphant!
Zaretsky was explains refusing; To stay for long he didn’t want:
As he to hate coquette decided Excited Lensky didn’t want
And passions which were mute and heartless; To praise yet you l don’t want;
Give arguments, but I do not: To quarrel ages don’t want.
What more you want?
To try to keep the indignation Her bps, such stubborn, now want!
Not far from Tanya, young and grieved, My dear dreamer quite respondent;
As if to prove that he was right. And Eugene, passionate, indulgent,
By dreadful exclamation Onegin’s shuddered; slain, impatient
Are silent.
To aim unseen at forehead pale, At distance try to make him silent.
What will he choose for his engagement?
That uhlan, slave of lot his own, With her should come to regiment.
Some balls, one children’s entertainment...
And yawned with happy wife and friend, Not troubled by the jealous torment;
Most be respected for the life. And true girl-friend in love’s adjustment
Reposes in heart contentment Like drunkard, spending night for payment,
At least three hours he daily In front of mirrors gladly spent,
Could come such proud or obedient, Could be attentive or indifferent;
The inns are absent.
Not secret tortures of the evil Would I in prose represent,
Could come of such a lazy mood. He didn’t join the guild existent
Haphazard wander to prevent.
And to the river, lightly clad Beneath the mounting he went;
The ringing voice of Olga, though, From Larin’s soon forever went:
They joked, not without sin At Tanya’s suitor made a hint.
About haying and of wine, Of kennels, of relation’s lint, -
But others made him disappoint! The slow languid was the point.
And stands at stint
Ah, if he knew, by what a cruel Offence. Tatyana’s heart was burnt!
Nor pictures nor a wisdom thought That Virgin or Racine had got,
The grammar; language from abroad For mother tongue they all had got.
Of any ink not any spot, In room two cupboards they had got:
From here, deeply lost in thought, He looked at threatening flame he got.
The mistress cries, ‘At last you’ve got!’
We all to learn had little go And anyhow something got,
But uncoordinated volumes From devil’s library all got,
Vladimir could have odes written, - To road them Olga never got.
The brigadier, a slave of God, Has peace by him forever got.
Is it high time as I forgot
‘And where is your friend, the former?- Vladimir such request has got, It seems, he us at all forgot.’.
Lornette his captious he has got,
Vladimir has the book to close; He takes a pen: his verse has got
He for meeting Arrived; is coming... just has got
The youthful years would be fading, The soul’s heat would not be hot
Began to aim... but quickly just Onegin shot...
It might he other: he’d he having Some common, plainful, simple lot:
And albums perfect but enormous, Of stylish rhymers racking lot,
Like drunkard tight by real Frenchmen Was captivated (dear lot!).
Through magic crystal I could not Myself discern all their lot.
But anyhow, dear reader, Alas! it was young lover’s lot:
Not...
And… he could not.
‘Do not.’
Is it not
At first are silent her observers, They look at her from head to foot;
They didn’t use the word a beauty To call her, but from head to foot
She’s nothing ever entertaining, For life she wouldn’t give a hoot..
But where now he is not... And where left he dismal rot.
Has been enlivened all the talk; In front of hostess light rot
Manzony, Herder; was re-reading Madame de Stael, Bichat, Tissot,
Became alredy quite inapt.
It’s nice to see when stubborn gracious He bends his horns to butt is apt,
And took him by the scruff of neck And in a gloomy corner kept.
Of youthful passion and of thought, Exalted, tender, bold, prompt?
Instead she sees unknown yard, The fence, the kitchen, mews, a cart.
Of grievous notes of the heart.
About other’s restless passions, And other’s love will touch the heart, -
Indeed, you won’t With all your pure flaming heart
For love all ages are submissive But to the innocent young heart
By honeyed dream he was amusing The doubts of his own heart;
Thus you, Yazykov, always wrote In gust of passion of your heart,
He showed tenderness. Such start Enlivens poor Tama’s heart.
Onegin Who loved the youth with all his heart
It’s all decided (it’s my version) By heavens board: I’m yours at heart.
But to no person In all the world I’d give my heart,
For me is now hard the gladness, Not only the grief... my heart...
In which 1 loved and suffered hard, And where buried I my heart.
Your tears, if you will be crying, Would never touch my gloomy heart,
To their talks pays none attention, In them she sees yet nothing smart,
For nowhere am I smart...
It is benevolent, releasing, Like vernal storms in fields make start
With which to start?
And is alive yet for the present, In philosophical sense desert,
It was an honourable, pleasant A challenge, or cartel quite short,
It was polite and not discrepant: For duel Lensky called, in short.
Insurgent youth is not yet endless. When Eugene was to change his sort
But whisper, laugh of fools can hurt..’
In times of hopes, tender sadness, Monsieur was driven from the court.
He could his feelings there show But not to bristle like a beast.
Away in lirical a heat, He cites like Delvig, drunk at feast.
You had, I saw, some little pity, Some small respect to age, at least...
May be, in vain he was at feasts Such careless and fine at least?
But at least
I haven’t force... is tired breast…
In form of merry, pretty jest With somewhat ruse, to have the breast
Adores my Olga: figure, breast!
To tell her something of the rest; Misgivings hardly squeezed her breast.
Of what a languor’s full her breast?
For tears her, by will suppressed - Her heart is torn in half at breast,
‘It’s mine!’ the voice of Eugene thunders! And all the gang has vanished fast.
And how long?’ ‘Two will he fast...’
And more five steps they neared striding, And Lensky screwed left eye more fast,
Again of scandals, and at last To altar I shall lead them fast,
And she herself renewed at last Night-cap and dressing-gown fast.
Up marble footsteps he has flown, With hand has mended hair fast.
He comes: the corks for ceiling pass, The wine like comet splashes fast.
Gvozdin, good master, who could shortly Make beggars of his peasants fast.
And always pity of the past; Enough, of other sing you fast!’
The spring of honour, idol last!
That, giving balls three times a year, He squandered all he had at last.
He’s very glad that former pass He changed for anything at last.
At bottom of my soul fast... But give them madrigal at last!
To scratch unfaithful icy path As he’s afraid to fall at last.
She stayed in frosty tone darkness: Young maiden is with Him at last.
To inner porch he goes fast, He’s laying down her at last.
A jet of steam yet hardly flashes, its whirling, vanishes at last.
With own wife that’s very portly Came stout Pustyakov at last;
And stilly does she say at last:
Visantine tubes with amber, treasures Of bronze and porcelain of the past;
Can it be real that at last My youth had withered in the past?
I liked his features in the past:
His father served for many years, And fell in debt, such big and vast,
But yet to make him be at rest Of pleasures won’t be the best.
Shall I portray in truthful picture Secluded study of the best,
‘My uncle keeps to honest systems: By falling ill yet not in jest,
Coquette is judging always coolly; Tatyana loves without jest,
For love she’s dedicated truly Like loyal child for mother’s nest,
New way I’m starting, do my best From all past life to take a rest.
Which came from neighbouring a valley; The peasants come to take a rest,
With heavenly her pride she’s touching The earth when conies to take a rest:
Let’s come together... take a rest...
Himself consoled if not suited, Betrayed - was glad to have a rest,
She sees a hall forgotten now, A cue on billiard has a rest,
The ‘else’s trends’, for you the best Among dull rhymers and the rest? -
He ceased to fall in love with beauties And dangled after like the rest;
On roan horses, three abrest; Arid let’s have dinner before rest!
In talks all’s plain, its all indifferent, Yet slander they without interest;
Monsieur l’Abbe, a Frenchman mere, To give the boy some chance to rest,
What would you feel if still, unmoving Your friend on earth is mute at rest
In house-keeping he was best Arid any problems put to test:
He made me love him with insistence And couldn’t find some better test.
She ordered secretly her granny: Prepare table for a guest...
The beds are made. And any guest
But hist!
In own family she was Like strange a girl in thoughts quite lost;
Not Eugene he’s at most?
Makes noise, is dark and grey, quite lost Yet isn’t frozen by frost.
He never wished to rummage quickly In chronological thick dust
The young scapegrace was so deeming, When he by post-chaise in dust
With jug young woman goes fast, By feet she crushes snow-dust.
‘I’m neighbour just’.
It seems to me, my wit is fading And silently I perish must.
‘Enough, get up, I now must
The fire’s dead; and under ashes Like gold is the coal’s crust;
Was shaking. Due to Zues he’s being The heir of all relatives in trust.
Deserted room alone filling You read; it’s Pradt, it’s Walter Scott.
When to the porch to part all went. At parting all they fussed about
In book’s short contents, finds she out Some words that should explain about
-But what about?
Her dream is sinister, it all At sad adventures pointed out.
The spring enlightened him, and now From dosed chambers he gets out,
Again promiscuosly he’s reading… Has read all Gibbon and Rousseau,
She loved the fraud about fears Of Richardson and by Rousseau.
But persons ordinary for us Are never strange, they fit all u.0
In this a dirty pool with you, My friends, I have a bath like you.
If I were poet like you.
With her, my lips will find anew Petrarka’s language ‘I love you’ .
You, Moscow, I thought of you!
Whatever are you, dear reader, A friend or not, I’d like with you
I might be deeply loving you, But getting used I’d run from you;
Each day in grief of separation By fickle fate, too far from you
Meantime account, made for you, In details I shall give to you,
To you I’ll give my service; forward You keep on mind my speech to you;
But what I’d want? what task am aiming By opening my heart. to you?
The world will me forget, but you My charming girl, will ever you
To what malicious merry-making, It may be, give a cause for you!
Do not be angry, dear. you Well know: I am dull for you...
At any place in front of you Your fatal tempter waits for you.
In them I marvelled at the virtue And fashioned arrogance, that hurts you,
Believe, I’d never try anew To look for better bride but. you.
‘For single winter it will do, At least I’ll credit money you’…

I love him, he’s my kin in-law.
In front of them when they were near White-stone Moscow they saw:
Lensky saw
Or Sbogar, mythical a few.
(A highly torturing a feeling, A voluntary cross of few).
But when his thoughts were of destroying His own rivals, though few,
Of life her features have but few.
And me you have in view...
What for would ever view
Or vagrant Melmoth, such distressful, Or Corsair, or Eternal Jew,
Among the friends the moon’s more shining; To Moscow all beauties flew.
Who loves you more than I can do Must here write a verse anew.
The peaceful life with him and you, Who pictured Finnish frosts anew.
I’ve heard some voice of new desire, I’ve got new sorrow anew;
And how could he be annoying The hearts of ladies, whom he knew!
Effects, but stepped away anew; He’s blessed much more, who never knew
And shelf with dusty books anew With mourning taffeta he drew.
And with a bow
He was in dances quick and light, Without tension he could bow:
How would you not love Moscow?
To-morrow we’ll Tanya show...
For changes fated anyhow...
In hands my fate for ever now, In front of you I tears shed: Defend my soul anyhow...
She’s been embarrassed, cannot now Him understand yet anyhow;
What kind’s he now anyhow?
At time of parting furthermore It beats like ready just to blow.
Across the torrent have been laid. In front of noisy gulf of flow,
A splendid house now shines, In windows some shades can flow,
Of lively lucid verse’s glow,
‘What, you are married! didn’t know!
D’you know?...
That spring of youth could quickly speed (As I could joke until now)?
For boston, lomber come in sight, For whist, well famous until now.
Is he the same or quiet now?
But now...
I would with joy allow To give this masquerade by now,
This kind of book yet doesn’t show The writer’s fancies in a row,
Two pistols in a row,
She near parents could bloom, Like lilies in the valley grow,

We haven’t any decent road, Forgotten bridges all decay.
And in a day
But at the window, not gay, Was mutely sitting all the day.
And then from people far away To give her lessons all the day?
But at the time of cold winter The drive is pleasant all the day:
The man, by muses once affected, As usual frowns alt the day.
Has brought. the sun and anyhow The merry festival name-day .
You’d better hurry up away. The shepherd at the break of day
On balcony at morning sitting She liked to meet the break of day,
Like life of bard, such simple, honest, Like kiss of love at dawn of day;
The shade of coming storm this way Is darkening all the breaking day.
He has a trouble from the feeling Of spook of unreturning day.
Desires, sorrows, some dreamings In soul crowded each day.
Without jokes By bore and rhyme depressed, all day
When he’s at home, always there By Olga is he kept all day.
All line and clever at his date, A bit ridiculous to-day.
From morning forth I must be sure, That I shall see you just to-day.
I see: my age is short: to cure My life for every other day,
Which pressed his spirits all the way And kept his laziness for day, -
‘Me?’ - Yes, Tatyana’s name-day happy Will be on Saturday...
And gradually rises day.
Then all they grandly went away, As if they spent a business day.
To pensiveness she got accustomed From cradle to the present day,
To all of kin the dinners row They take my Tanya every day
In which a bloody, dreadful shade To him appeared every day.
She’s playful, careless and gay, Well, just the same as every day.
Like he, she was well-dressed, in fashion, In best attires every day;
You let me now my ideas To tell you all this very day.
Among all those ardent days Of boiling youth, such bright and gay,
On river’s batik; and far away In front of it, all looking gay,
And drifting of the country’s pastime In all her dreams looked better, gay.
The herds make noise; of nightingale The song at silent night is gay.
She’s dutiful and always modest, As fresh as morning, always gay,
All evening Lensky was distracted, Was now silent, now gay;
The further I’m from youth my gay,
By rays of day will shine the morning And brightly will be playing clay,
Zaretsky cautiously could lay
By crimson hand not seen by now The dawn from morning towards the lay
He loved the method with his passion: To make a man on earth to lay
‘I fell in love’, again she whispers In nurse’s ear in dismay.
The nurse was using own way To help the girl with cross and pray.
And. so cunny, she is gay. Already’s able to betray!
With youthful years gets away, And my Zaretsky, I would say,
At home meets without tension, At visits two-three words would say
What do you want to ask, you say!
Some words, yet stilly, tries to say, But at the table could she stay.
Such dread! She wants to be away, In thickets of the woods to stay.
But soon, not asked for her concession, Was to the altar led away.
Her tired look and slipped away...
At break of dawn the night is cold; In cornfields work has ceased away;
Forgive me thickets In which my days have passed away,
Of fraud she knows nothing strictly And wants to dream her life away?
And you, the girls all young, good looking, Whom droshkies quickly take away
I lagged behind as their member And ran away...
The bugs and fleas at stations lone Each minute take your sleep away.
His eyes the books were reading, But all his thoughts were far away;
And of romantic finest rose. He sang of countries: far away
Her head to shoulder’s inclining, Her light chemise is now sliding From charming shoulder away...
She’s trembling like persued a doe, Her darkening eyes she hides away
And she, as if she’s burned by flame, Has stopped at once and looks away...
Of album leaflets with his care To decorate he works away;
Through nose singingly could say, But soon her mood could pass away:
Or may be guessed from far away That uncle his would pass away.
To call some people gets away.
‘What’s happened?’- `Nothing’… - Gets away.
Grandchildren once upon good day Will press from world all us away.
‘I fell in love... you’d get away
When clouds in the sky are drifting And stars in turn all get away,
Unwaited coming any day And each delay to get away.
She went away.
From Romul to the present day - In depth of mind he kept away.
And all grandparents exclaim: ’But how years fly away!’
His horse the snow feels at present, Its trotting, lazily away.
At him she stares all the way:
With his she-wolf, in hunger bold, A wolf is coming to the way;
Young triumphant peasant On wooden sledge renews the way.
Then we’ll submissively obey To hear stories by the way
Moldavia, that’s far away From Italy, was end of way.
In late of evening, such amusing, Along the Petersburg high-way,
From mountains descends this way
‘What way?
Like senseless rhymes of stylish In winter’s even every way.
For silent room alone getting At once the whole world forgetting With nobody nearby
They scared love quite timid, shy., But they attracted lovers by
You get along the Neva’s route, Newborn by me the work of fancy;
Onegin’s quick to dress. Already His sernant’s ordered to be ready
I am engulfed by trembling vice: An epigram is being ready
But will and power of mind All overcame, and she already
I see you strong already!
To cry, to weep I’m now ready...’ -I see, you are unwell already
And he was sure: friends are ready To suffer all for him already,
The afternoon he passes, ready Again to waste his day already.
But stealthily the door unlocking Grey-haired nurse already’s walking, With tea on tray is coming up: -My child, it’s time for getting up; But, beauty, you are now ready!
Has come; to servant says he will Lepage’s fatal barrels steady
You, country Priams, should be ready; And you, each sensitive a lady:
Ah! I’ll forever keep in mind Small feet of lady.
«It’s time to change them in a body,
The way to keep her man away! And everything became o’key.
H’m, h’m! You, generous my readers, Are all your kinsfolk o’key?
Tatyana was the name of sister... Such name we use to gratify
The novel’s pages of my either, At will that name well sanctify.
To whom in secret you did write Some verse, your sins to justify,
On jade postillion’s sitting ragged, Emaciated, beard’s shaggy.
More pretty than a parquette fashioned, The river, clad in ice, is flashy,
And wayward, willful is her head? Or heart is flaming, tender, healthy?
And Flyanov who is not quite healthy, On chairs in a room are wealthy.
On blue, with slashes covered, ice The sun is gay; the snow’s filthy
Of how state itself enriches, And how lives, which way and why
All’s By now much dilapidated, Indeed, I don’t know why.
Tatyana (Russian in her soul, Herself she doesn’t know why)
With flocks of snow; through the crowns Of naked birches from the sky
The night then comes, the moon is mooving Around distant parts of sky;
K. Vyasemsky.
‘Shall we begin?’ ‘Perhaps,’ says Lensky.
Baratynsky.
Meanwhile far off The honest person and Zaretsky
Zhookovsky
Maiden’s singing intimate, Don’t peep invisibly
From them: she new blazes greatly, She feels herself in passion badly;
Offended you at bottle badly, Or if yet he, annoyed, quite madly
When in the garden’s alley fine The fate us brought together; sadly
What does the kinsfolk mean namely?
The pilgrim young, you know why, Should long ago home fly.
He looks and sees: the time is high Away from yard for mill to fly.
She got afraid and in a hurry Tatyana tries away to fly
And listening Id my singing rhyme From banks they all together fly.
The reapers dip the jars for best Arid pleasant clear water daily.
-To Larin’s -’Oh, looks it strangely: To kill your pretty evenings daily…
And from his dressing room he went Like giddy Venus, when quite gaily,
As soon as I recall your stare And that your homily...
Let us play inventfully, Lot us play more happily,
Let’s away get rapidly, Him bespatter easily
You all, whom decorated guickly Tolstoy with brush such wondrous, sweatily,
Then gets he out of the yard, At home falls asleep too quickly,
By name he was Vladimir Lensky. With Göttingen in soul frankly,
Explain to you, do it frankly.
But really?
Or, like coquette, he simply boomed? By his good will Or willy-nilly
It means the following thing mainly:
Of writings of the life in past, But ancient anecdotes deeply -
Quite egoistic, selfish, dry, To dreaming dedicated greatly
Exactly...
With the berries laughingly, Don’t hear secretly
When we get that fellow, When we see him, instantly
You are like comrade, 1 believe, To help are ready always gently,
Five hundred years), roads, may be, In all the state will change invently:
Of morning flower which then At halt of life must wither faintly’.
What are you: angel guardian trusty Or tempter treacherous and ghastly?
And I, untroubled, glorified The girl from rocks, ideal my,
Through all her fate, severe, ruling. This crank, this dangerous and a gloomy
‘You send your grandchild stilly there To give this note to... to my...
To me alone could he bring His dawn of life, such sad and stormy!’
‘To me you wrote, Do not deny.
- You tell me, nanny,
The branch has no wreath; Beneath, alone, grey and puny,
Of Corneille stately genius; there Was known prickly Shakhovskoy
And under curtain fine, all silky, In her new bed she is unsleepy,
She’s still and simple at a glimpse. She seemed to be a certain copy,
Or even own demon mine. Onegin (him I’ll occupy),
He makes a sign and all they bother; He drinks and all they drink and cry;
He’s killing Lensky; horrid shading Lays down, then a dreadful cry
And can’t; she’s now deeply worrier!, She moans and she’d like to cry...
All bow, shuffle, gladly smile, Wet-nurses scream, the babies cry.
And seems to be yet hardly live: But Tanya simply couldn’t cry,
You don’t let be cooled my soul, Become embittered, hardened, dry,
Each shutter’s open, and dry
Ah, brethren! pleased I was then greatly When many curches, each with belfry,
Like crank by chance at feast enormous He’s angry.
We sing of their lucky fate And glory!
But, seems to me I’d wish, of course To fill my fate with kind of glory.
I checked it all, and very strictly; In many places contradictory,
For all the childish tricks felt sorry, To them was stranger; dreadful story
But forward, forward, you, my story!
With care steps on icy brim And slips, and falls; all fluffy, merry
To leave the world I would he sorry.
(With all that I began my thought). But when he reached it in a hurry,
Well, to present you I shall try’
For hot discussions of the gentry, The terror of the midnight sentry;
Creation of the hell or sky, This angel, haughty devil wry,
Is pictured rather well correctly With his immoral soul wry,
Vladimir answered short, was dry. Then he was mute, his face was wry.
Thanks God, had any wish to try; But at the life his look was wry.
He laughs - they all are laughing further: He frowns - all are srient, wry.
Or sleeping over the Lethe The poet is quiet, easy,
But I am ready to refuse As its translation isn’t easy.
Which seemed to be more tender, rich; And with the trustful blind entreaty
But why Talyana should be guilty?
With whom we all to sleep had gone; - For tender girl, the dreamer hearty,
For evening party...
Her love but fright nevertheless, Main person of this novel pretty!
Unwillingly, with sighs of pity: He’s blessed, who knew all their pretty
In her could never find a hook To use the word on fashion’s duty,
‘Agreed’ - You... dear guy!
Did not remember love and spite, Behaved like some indifferent guy
The world said: why, He is a clever, pretty guy.
XXXY
With talks about novel hazy; With symbol, making sisters crazy;
The noise, the laughter, running, bows, Mazurka, gallop, waltz.

A bee to fields, of tribute well,
A bloody roast-beef is given, And truffles, splendour of teenage,
A book at mornings here read...
A bottle of some light sweet wine, Some solitude, the stillness fine:
About feasts, enormous, fine, About meals and corks I wrote
About girls, you meant above, And how did you fall in love?
About haying and of wine, Of kennels, of relation’s lint, -
About Lensky’s wedding all Were sure neighbours once for all.
About news and fashions dear With dolls she didn’t talk at all,
About other’s restless passions, And other’s love will touch the heart, -
About what she’s now dreaming?
Above this urn, to fate submissive, A wreath mysterious could swing.
A bowl
A brave sledge-cart from field’s returning, It’s fluffy furrows upturning,
Accept you all my thankful feelings Admirer of peaceful muse,
Across a glade, all under snow Around which all’s dark and sad.
Across the pits the sleigh is speeding, Is passing by the stalls, the women,
Across the torrent have been laid. In front of noisy gulf of flow,
Admires all the noisy tightness, The flash of dresses and of words,
Adorer of the glory, freedom, Immersed in own stormy thought,
Adores my Olga: figure, breast!
Adulteries were not adonng; His friends and freindship made him boring,
A dwarf with tail; and there’s that Who’s half-a-crane and half-a-cat.
Affected native Russian banns, And all the neighbours were amused.
A forest stands; a stout pine Is still and frowned, yet is fine
Again he, downcast and thoughtful, In front of dear Olga stands;
Again his time Onegin counts, Again the day is dragging forth;
Again of scandals, and at last To altar I shall lead them fast,
Again promiscuosly he’s reading… Has read all Gibbon and Rousseau,
Against Tatyana in a row They sit. Of morning moon more pale
Aggressive lenders each offends, Each has his own wit and sense.
‘Agreed’ - You... dear guy!
Ah, brethren! pleased I was then greatly When many curches, each with belfry,
Ah, dear, all my inner feeling
-Ah, dear my! in my teenager We heard yet nothing of the love,
Ah, don’t mind’ -My friend, by God to hail I dare —
‘Ah, Eugene!’, - She is quickly running, Like shade she’s prompt, to exit’s jumping, From porch for garden through the yard She flies, to look yet back it’s hard; In short a minute she’s been racing Across the bridges and the glade, Along the forest, brook, the lake, She is the lilac bushes breaking, Through flowers she runs... in wrench Without breath she reached a bench,
‘Ah, father my! the profit’s worsened..’.
Ah, feet, in vain I was affected.
Ah, feet, such small, where are you flow, What vernal plants are trampling yet?
Ah, he could love; they don’t now Have anything like real love
Ah, if he knew, by what a cruel Offence. Tatyana’s heart was burnt!
(A highly torturing a feeling, A voluntary cross of few).
Ah! I’ll forever keep in mind Small feet of lady.
Ah, many friends were near then!
Ah, many were by fate denied!
‘Ah, my Lord!’,
‘Ah, nanny, that is quite (mother, I’m never bothered by your wit; I speak of letter, you should fit For that Onegin’ -Well done dealing.
Ah, never impulse of the sense Put rack my soul ever hence.
Ah, no one, my friends, believe me!
Ah, Olga gave the word to him,
‘Ah, poor Yorick, said he, joyful
‘Ah, Tanya!
A hundred times is blessed, who’s faithful. Who’s got his wit to be quite calm,
Ah, who would not her silent feelings At this quick moment have read!
‘Ah, will you do a favour, nanny?’ -All right, my dear, you command.-
Ah, you, whose memory will fuse In verse my flying feeble dealings,
Aid he awoke; they are bringing A letter: him prince N. is bidding
A jet of steam yet hardly flashes, its whirling, vanishes at last.
A jug for apple juice he took, An old calendar in order:
A lady’s love until to-day To speak her Russian isn’t trying,
Alas! all days and nights are now One long and lone dream in heat,
Alas! for funs, which can be differed, I’ve ruined much of own life.
Alas! I must repeat again:
Alas, it’s easy to divine!
Alas! my Eugene, no doubts, With Tanya is in love like child;
Alas! On furrows of lives
Alas, Tatyana’s daily fading: She’s paling, sinking and is mute,
Alas! young bride, if she were trying, To sadness loyal couldn’t be.
Ali that has gone like sound’s fizz, And dear Tanya’s youth all dwindles:
All are amazed, my Lensky sighs, Does not believe his own eyes.
All barking, dogs to her are running.
All bow, shuffle, gladly smile, Wet-nurses scream, the babies cry.
All days I spent in sleep, in shades, And there had my happiest days.
All double lanterns in the sight Are stretching their joyful light,
All envied by the hard, yet living! In worldly storms - of life oblivion,
All evening Lensky was distracted, Was now silent, now gay;
All fancy goods for whims abundant Which are supplied by busy London
All fashioned model of the creature Who’s dressed, undressed, anew redressed.
All flows in a single gear...
All given up in summer heat. To count days he simply hated,
All have the supper.
All heads are now grandly shaking The neighbours whisper (they are wailing):
All innocent the talkings flow; With lie they beautify some things,
All line and clever at his date, A bit ridiculous to-day.
All lots that time became alike; And then I married, I would like
All my confessions must you take: For judgement yours I give my fate.
All neighbours came by closed sleigh, By hooded carts, by britzkas, sledge...
All over the Baltic waves For forest, fat and hand-made lace;
All over the Neva river, When waters, being gaily light,
Allow me, the readers mine, To show you her elder line.
All peasants-men there are enriching, They get the silver with a spade,
All poets, meanwhile I’ll note, Of dreamy, pensive love are friends,
All point at her, such young and fine, And all they cry: ‘It’s mine! Its mine’
All right, by hand unfair own
All satisfied at feast by dinner The neighbours puff in room, the inner;
All’s blight, all’s white without shade.
All’s By now much dilapidated, Indeed, I don’t know why.
All servant maidens in the yard To guess the fortune were accustomed,
All servants gathered at the gate To part with barins.
All services of old time.
All’s filled by Him, by image dear, And magic force, that she can hear,
All’s good: for vigil and for sleep Will come the hour well geared;
All’s now calm; in rooms you hear: Is snoring heavy Pustyakóv
All that I don’t grasp.
All that I gladlessly survived.
- All they are yet feeling
All they utter
All things by Paris craft invented To help the idle hungry taste
All those changes. All the more He, full of jealous indignation,
All us, well laugh at their impulse, At late ridiculous opinions,
All wine from goblet at his hand Was not till end life’s novel reading,
All yet living
Alone’s sitting, pale and thin, She is some letter now reading,
Alone to my nurse, who’s being My old friend from youth and forth.
Alone with his soul’s self Unsatisfied was by himself.
Alone you, to speak my mind, I’d take as friend of days my grievous,
Along the darkish sky is flying To scatter in the sky afar,
Along unfinished rhymes of words No girl’s small feet and no heads.
A lot of pretty loving rot; He it declaims; the sound flows
A lot of stories with the whirls, With wicked ghosts and the girls...
Already for triumph he’s waiting,
Already I of plan was thinking, Of name of person number one,
Alter him
A menu hangs for order’s sake And teases appetite in vain.
A mere hit from all I’d give.
A mill is squatting in the dancing, By wings it crackles, flaps, is glancing.
Among admirers obedient I’ve seen she-cranks of other kinds:
Among all those ardent days Of boiling youth, such bright and gay,
Among his properties alone, To pass away his lazy time,
Among his victories to thrive, And his amusements gratifying?
Among Moldavian dismal thickets She visited marquees in peace
Among the children would he die At hands of doctors, weepers, wife.
Among the friends the moon’s more shining; To Moscow all beauties flew.
Among the hills in semicircle Well go there where brook
Among the people wise quite choicely To pass for feigned a queer. fish,
Among the servants-maids-teenagers.
Among the songs in books decrepit Somewhere issued was that lilt; Triquet with poet’s keen wit For world from dust that rhyme extracted,
A monk in black by chance appears, Or quick a hare in the fields
Amusements or for dreams a nook, Some thoughts for heart, for journal’s clamour
Amusing idle gaze, all miles Are glimpsing like a fence in eyes.
A mute reproach, begging looks, - All that she grasps.
And after rather tedious dinner, When I, refreshing own inner,
And albums perfect but enormous, Of stylish rhymers racking lot,
And all around dreams in still, With light of moon its all fulfilled.
And all entrust in singing voice The secrets of the maiden’s choice,
And all grandparents exclaim: ’But how years fly away!’
And all to her it seems quite wealthy, Revives her languid soul’s rate
And always pity of the past; Enough, of other sing you fast!’
And always turned, from us - I mean. That their looks give rise for spleen.
And am I soon at thirties turn?
And as a law for me imputing Of passions tyrany unique,
And asks him stilly, sweetly sighs More tenderer than reed-pipe dear:
And at the brook in thickened shade Is put a monument just made.
And being free, again	revel In girl from Venece, pretty, young,
And boring pictures’ row, done In style of La Fontaine’s sweet novels.
And by degrees but is beginning Tatyana him to comprehend -
And by degrees to sleep he’s reading His passions, thoughts, his own wit:
And by the people’s usual custom On Christmas must we come to see;
And by the salt of worlds backbiting
And calmly edge of earth is lighting, And, sign of day, the wind is rising,
And can’t; she’s now deeply worrier!, She moans and she’d like to cry...
And christened world will have the will To build per station own inn.
And comes to bouieward quite forlone: He there at a space is walking
And could of high oppressive order All manners quickly imitate!
And, covered with the frosted gown, His beaver collar now sparks.
And didn’t frighten anyone By natural vividness and fun,
And dreams as well as cartomancies, The moons predictions in the skies.
And dreams, that she with him as wife Will pass the peaceful mute of life!
And drifting of the country’s pastime In all her dreams looked better, gay.
And drop some tears twice or thrice; They needed kvass not less than air,
And early ringing of the bells (Precursor of the morning works)
And even by her trembling hands To lift her dress ashamed she's here;
And even nonsense having joys This idle world each time avoids.
And even this my chapter five — From all digressions to refine.
And everywhere finds some mark... But none relief she is yet finding
And exclamations at the board:
And fair sex like down’s slight...
And falsely sings, Applauds and crying Are greeting him.
And far niente is my law.	 I wake at mornings to adore
And flitting quickly snow-storm Is shining, whirling. But at all
And Flyanov who is not quite healthy, On chairs in a room are wealthy.
And from his dressing room he went Like giddy Venus, when quite gaily,
And fugitive of world and people, For stylish beauties stylish man,
And full of truth which he can meet His elegies like rivers fleet.
And gave this person all the beauty, And made him wrongly persecuted;
And gaze attentive of her maidens; She daily greatly is depressed;
And girls, at banks Salgirian captured.
And give you all that 1 could scribble
And glory of the old starts, And panting dreams of all young hearts
And God forbid at evening party Or after ball, at porch, on step
And got to neighbours in a while. At once they heartily were given
And gradually rises day.
And great belief in world’s perfection, Forgive him ardour of his age,
‘And happiness was not unlikely, And so near!
And happy rights for own self Like haughty Moscow itself.
And heated by the pure passion This agitated person bade
And… he could not.
And he inspired her at dawns!
And he invents by whim’s requests Caricatures of the guests.
And her attires, such belating, And her belating tune of speech!
And here is the banns room.
And here she, exhausted, sad In tears bad a cough has had.
And he returned just to the hall Like Chatsky: from the ship for ball.
And he was sure: friends are ready To suffer all for him already,
And he with pleasure long ago Was meeting him; that’s why at borne
And him repentance badly nags; This inspiration often adds
And hostile shore, I shall be rushing To come to midday desert steppe
And how could he be annoying The hearts of ladies, whom he knew!
And how long?’ ‘Two will he fast...’
And how often muse my tender Delighted silent route for me
And how, with your heart and mind, To he the slave of sense, not kind?
And I confess: from them I fled: It seemed with horror I had read
And I had found then, amazing: By their bashful, stern behaving
And I’ll remind the speech of passion, The words of longing, wistful love
And I’m afraid: in spite of charm That water brings me much of harm...
And I’m in family unknown...
And impulses of virgin dream, And grand simplicity in him.
And in a day
And in addition gave to them Collection of plain fables then, With them two Pentads, a grammar.
And in a while of storm the track In soul mine will soon be ceasing,
And in his own study silent Remembered times, when after him
And in the solitude severe Her passion’s heating yet much more,
And in the world could help to back Seductive though small respect?
And into sweet and sinless dream By soul he was getting in.
And is alive yet for the present, In philosophical sense desert,
And is it true, it can’t return?
And I, untroubled, glorified The girl from rocks, ideal my,
‘And I was gingebread you giving!’
And I was proud among friends Of new she-friend with windy trends.
And I, while thinking of Swetlana,
And I - with sighing I confess - Am dangling after her much less.
‘And I your ears pulled by hands!’
And leaf by leaf through it is looking But nothing to her sister says...
And leaning mutely on the door Is writing elegies for her,
And leans on him with trembling hands; All fearful she’s shyly stepping
And Lei is soaring above head: And under pillow unmoving
And let them God long live for us!
And like the Beccant could she gamble, With bowl sang she for the guests,
And like with friends, for long well known, With all the meadows and groves
And listening Id my singing rhyme From banks they all together fly.
And magic poison of its itches; You are pursued by happy dream,
And make some rainbows on snow. By lampions dotted from the sides
And many boys with joyful cries Are scaring on sonorous ice;
And many pages yet are keeping Some sharpened markings by the nail;
And many verses, jokes, whims, And arguments, and merry dreams.
And may be tracks of secret fear Of own husband and of world
And me you have in view...
And more five steps they neared striding, And Lensky screwed left eye more fast,
And much the more it’s nice in silence For him prepare honest grave,
And my in life success at random, My stylish place, the guests till night,
And near it (when it is raining In spring on corns of near fields),
And no brow moved she rasher; She didn’t even lips her press.
And no hope!... full of sadness, He now curses own madness.
And no nonsense in the world Or epigram with brutal word
And not because the Grandison To Lovelace was by her prefered;
And nothing cooled his strong belief:
And now at your will is rather To punish me with scorn for that.
And now, free from humid stopper, Each bottle bangs and all the wine
And now in my garden small She came at once as district mistress,
And now jealouser’s triumphant!
And now North, all clouds driving,
And -now she with great attention Voluptuous novels quickly reads,
And now sullen, now harmful Ideas trouble late his dream.
And now Tanya is alone Alas! for long-time friend she sighs,
And of Onegin, far from here, Her heart reminds much more to her.
And of romantic finest rose. He sang of countries: far away
And often at Taurida’s beaches She brought me in the have of night
And often in the summer’s sphere, When clear is the sky at night
And of the world new lustre, noise Fulfilled his wit with future joys.
And old barin room this had;
And Olga’s yawning; round here She’s looking for her Lensky dear.
And own pawn with own rook Distracted Lensky there took,
And parents foresaw the fate: Were calculating wedding date;
And passed away of tears time?
And passions which were mute and heartless; To praise yet you l don’t want;
And placid, solidly effected, In style of clever old time.
And proud language’s now lit For prose postal a bit.
And quickly both they yet off
And rent the ear-rings of gold; Then brittle snows fastly hold
Andryushka, quicker must you go!
And sadly shedding hitter tears To part with Olga mother nears
And saying so, made he dry A glass to health of dear neighbour,
And secrets of her own heart, Her sacred tears, happy tension
And seems to be yet hardly live: But Tanya simply couldn’t cry,
And semicircle wide of brides,- All that at once one’s feelings strikes.
And several days she after that Had been entroubled, deeply sad.
And several minutes after that With her the waltz again he’s dancing.
And she, as if she’s burned by flame, Has stopped at once and looks away...
And sheds of tears stilly stream, Her cheek on hand she has to lean.
And she forgot the speech of gods For scant and queer lots and lots
And she has had
And she herself renewed at last Night-cap and dressing-gown fast.
And she insensibly is drifting, She doesn’t move and doesn’t breathe;
And she is squeaking (dear me!): In gold chamber visit me!...
And shelf with dusty books anew With mourning taffeta he drew.
And she, that young and lovely creature;
And she to empty house went In which had lived the novel’s crank.
And slowly through fields she’s riding, Immersed is deeply in the dream:
And smelling dead the horses snort And struggle; they with white wet loam
And. so cunny, she is gay. Already’s able to betray!
And so grew they old both.
And stands at stint
And stilly does she say at last:
And stilly neared me in calmness. I think its you with love and brightness Could whisper full of hopes word.
And stubbornly he looks; but she Is sitting quietly, she’s free.
And suddenly my Lensky enters, With hire Onegin.
And Tanya hides her agitation, But yet she’s sighing once again
And Tatyana’s nervous
And that... but afterwards you’ll know, Is not it true?
And then at prince she was adjusting
And then departures for the way, But asks before for invitation
And then from people far away To give her lessons all the day?
And then he dressed himself...
And then in secret could defame them By merry jest or real he.
And then I shall begin to rhyme New couplets, more than twenty five,
And then I thought: He’s now in;
And then was speaking of the same: Of Olga, dear love, again!
And there… -
And there, in the shades of links, My younger days were rushing things,
And they expressed the common wish To call him dangerous queer fish.
And though Eugene, as we know, For long from reading turned his face,
And thought of her in him inspired First moan of his conscious life.
And thus... But what a fool I am I They call you: come next week to them.-
And thus my hero grin; At minute, difficult for him,
And thus the time would pass; meanwhile They ask, and Olga tea prepares;
And. told her:
And took him by the scruff of neck And in a gloomy corner kept.
And to Onegin with wry smile From poet he gives for reading A leaf.
And to the river, lightly clad Beneath the mounting he went;
And to the same and strict revealer, To neighbourhood occasions gave.
And trembling state is seen by him; All vexed, he’s being in a whim.
And unattentive smart lornette.
And under curtain fine, all silky, In her new bed she is unsleepy,
And Vertcr, that rebellious martyr, Unimitable Grandison
And wayward, willful is her head? Or heart is flaming, tender, healthy?
And we adored, like in a dream, Some song of horn and man, such bold...
And we... with nothing can we shine, We all to see you are adoring.
And what?
And what? -
And what?
And what?
And what.
And what can give me fate of mine?’
And what for is can now lurid?
And what insidiousness you show, When you amuse a man half dead
And what’s Onegin doing?
And what’s the reason?
And when a falling shining star
And when sometimes in front of her
And where everything’s at freedom? The same yet girl... or its a dream?
And where is her sister line?
‘And where is your friend, the former?- Vladimir such request has got, It seems, he us at all forgot.’.
And whispered her each one of them: ‘You look left side at those men…’
And who, d’you think, from it is looking?
And who inspired touching talk Which looks like madman’s hearty mock.
‘And whom?’ - She’s Larin’s. -
‘And whom your lovely verse adored?’
And who that poor Tanya previous In this princess could not have met!
And who would look for maiden tender In this majestic casual manner
And with a bow
And with her eyes all them adoring She looks around and she speaks:
And with Onegin’s recollecting Some jokes, pranks of old date,
And wondered: would he be alive?’
And works again imagination. Again her touch of fascination
And yawned with happy wife and friend, Not troubled by the jealous torment;
And you agree, my dear reader: This time like real gentleman
And you, ‘Bordeaux’ you came friendly, Like friend in trouble and in grief,
And you forgive, my freedom later!
And you have right to it, not duties, Among rebellious storms, I mean,
And you, my reader dear, gracious, In your borouch from other land
And you, my youthful inspiration, Disturb my weak imagination,
And young a woman, city dweller All summer in the country spender
And you, the girls all young, good looking, Whom droshkies quickly take away
And youth of those vanished days All after her could wildly dangle;
And you, well known dear wood, And charming skies of neighbourhood.
A need for sleep.
A nightingale in haze of night His loud melodies is tuning.
An Lane’s home from the morning Is full of guests, of kin adoring:
Annette; And on the last one you read so:
Annoyance? bustle? or anew Some love - the trouble of the youth?
Annoyance, jealousy could vanish In front of eyes with clear relish,
A passionate epistle’s writing.
A pedant but of science man. He had a happy talent then:
A plain inscription, then she tries To stop the dim in tender eyes.
A poet by will of goodness, New devil then will enter me;
Apostate of wild enjoyments,
Appeared-vanished quickly rather, We gee, but don’t we. confess.
Appear profiles of heads Of ladies and of fashion cranks.
Appolo’s children took it sacred; For Albion proud lyre rated
Are blessed the troubles of the day, Is blessed the darkness of the gravel
Are drying valleys many-coloured;
Are full of piety, of wit, Such cautious, that we can’t endure,
Are kissing, tenderly press hands, They flop her curls up to the fashion,
Are not, or far away are living, As Sadi said before I write.
Are shut the shutters, limed are flirted The windows.
Are silent.
Are snow-bound by the storm. In depth of snow are forlorn.
Are troubled house-spirit gangs; Onegin’s eyes make tire own,
Are wetting iron hard curb-bit, Like shaft they gallop with all speed.
Are you the same, or others dared To change, replace you there all?
Arid, following Petrarka’s tracks, Could calm his heart’s the biggest trouble.
Arid though ladies can be talking Of Say and Bentham at the walking,
Arid thus we now part, forgive!
Arise and ripen, then will fall, And others after them come all,
Arose noise at parting grades: They bring from stables eighteen jades.
Around carriage of the young; To see them off Tatyana flung.
Around ladies dark a frame Of gaping, like at pictures, men.
Around Tanya ladies crowd,
Arrange the pillows in bed Then give him drugs in sadness, though
Arrival slow of the guests In front of hostess young brightness,
Arrives he now every day; Her follows like own shade:
As at the reason of the parting Tatyana’s grumbling at the brook,
As he indifferently could yawn Inside antique or modern hall.
A shepherd bast gay sandal’s making, Of fishers from the Volga sings.
As he to hate coquette decided Excited Lensky didn’t want
As idols now to have got Or Vampire, who’s lost in thought,
As if by greenish down covered.
As if to prove that he was right. And Eugene, passionate, indulgent,
A simple maiden
As I to loose my freedom feared Which’s hateful to my own will.
As legends say of old age (For that we’d praise in him the sage).
A smooth-tongued voice of world, it happened, His evil bravery could praise:
As no knowledge they had had, And dearly were deformating
As now not at any time He could bear-steaks and Strassburg pie
As object of the judging noisy, In life you’d never have a wish:
A sound sleep, the walks, the reading. The forest shade, of brooks the hiss, -
As pawn that’s worth of dear mate.
A splendid house now shines, In windows some shades can flow,
As quick as can
As real expert does by chance. He could be silent in discussion,
As sign of friendship’s written in, Continued, lessened for the whim.
As sign of lust for future being The master of her home, child
As soon as I recall your stare And that your homily...
As they are mean and simple features, You won’t see fine art in that.
As they them wrote many years Of might, as it through ages came..’
Astonished being and amazed, - As if by nothing she was harassed:
A stream Like silver shines. And after dream By hornlet peasants have been waking.
As well as bees from tasty house With noise are flying for the bloom
(As well as in the old years In time of mine and time of yours),-
As well as poor moth is blending And shines like rainbowed a thing
As well as ruddy foolish moon At the horizon’s foolish brightness’.
As well as seeds in vital strife In earth by spring are given life.
At any novel those features, Her own portrait, very nice;
At any place in front of you Your fatal tempter waits for you.
At any place there are some chambers, Of damask are in rooms wallpapers,
At any place you fancy him, The refuge for the happy wishes;
At any sides we’ll hills divide, Will dig the tunnels under waters;
At boring aunt’s my Tanya meeting Once Vyasemisky in his good age
At boring stage some known actor, And, turning to unknown world
At bottom of my soul fast... But give them madrigal at last!
At break of dawn the night is cold; In cornfields work has ceased away;
At brook the monument is seeing She’s drawing made of leather rein,
At clavichords he had been sitting, But only for chords was fitting;
At clear morning he is leaving, In sledge along the river flies.
At crumpled canopy lies next A riding switch.
At dawn who never knows yet The evening where will he spend.
At early morning comes for meeting With lone canopy again.
At. fifty who was liberated From private and from other debts,
‘At fire-place Alone barin sat for days.
At fire-place the table’s lain: Onegin’s waiting - Lensky’s speeding
At first are silent her observers, They look at her from head to foot;
At first his language me confused,
At first I wished to keep it secret; Believe me: never of my shame You’d guess, as I would well behave
At first of them she didn’t think, But their choice seemed queer thing, And she was lost in their reading,
At first they came to him for visit But as he usually was gone
At first they’d nothing seen In common.
At first two days anew he drove Along secluded lone fields
At foggy rivers And hills the moon just dasappears.
At goose’s neck a skull is fateful, It’s whirling round for all sides;
At her much frightened loud cries
At her to gaze he was assidious, But no tracks of Tanya previous
At him she stares all the way:
At his Penates, quite permissive Vladimir honoured all, who died;
At home coffee used to drink; Were poor journals for him waiting.
At home did he shut himself And yawning, tried to write of self.
At home had to work a lot; And he went out; but my Eugene
At home he took out pistols To check them up, then put them back
At home meets without tension, At visits two-three words would say
At inner room a cry just bangs: Princess is ill in bed, but fusses.
At Kharitónya’s in the alley In front of house at the gate
At last before the dawn of morning His tired head on table’s falling
At last he fast awakes from dream, Apart the flaps of curtain’s moving
At last he gave it up, and failing, Himself he found at her dwelling.
At last it stopped.
At last like dead to petrify In deadly thrill of world on whole;
At last she’s very deeply sighing, From little bench is getting
At least he’d my advice have held: Refuse the modes antiquated,
At least regret, sincere pity, At least by sounds of the speech,
At least three hours he daily In front of mirrors gladly spent,
At Lensky Eugene looks quite forceless.
At margins of the books she’s meeting Of reader’s pencil slightest signs:
At meetings but without lights, And tears, secret torment’s gladness...
At nameless river, small and fine. In village where Eugene mine,
At neighbour’s monument submissive He dedicated him a sigh;
At Olga then he fixed his gaze And whispered: ‘I’ve my happy days...’
At once Anisya then appeared; Through porch the way was quickly cleared
At once behind the door awakens The sound of bassoon from band:
At once was frightened my Tatyana...
At other kinds of lines.
At own billiard with two balls He played from morning one for all.
At people looks she, never smirking, Without imitating tricks…
A trice ago was he living And his young heart was full of feeling,
At rocks of the Caucasian districts
At sea I wait for better season, The sails of ships I call, I feel,
(At season, which is called meanwhile The time of wolf and dog for meetings,
At sea to hear for a while Of nereid unceasing whispers,
At Simeon’s he’s now Living. He saw me at Twelfth-night sometime, His son was married then meanwhile.
At sister Tanya isn’t looking; She lies in bed; a book she has
At smooth of parquets in the halls, At sea on granite and at malls.
At start of novel good ideal In thicket of a distant place,
At such a year, such an age.
At table each of dear guests Had course according to the ranks.
At Tanya tries to be impressing My unreclaimed yet now crank.
At the beginning of my novel — (In chapter first you look it all)
At the games of maidenhood.
At the ideal, fashioned word, A stilly dream my Lensky had.
At their fascinating signs The flaming looks of men are fleeting.
At time of parting furthermore It beats like ready just to blow.
Attractiveness; to catch in nets By first expressing some regret
At twenty dandy was with brain, At thirty married was with gain,
At usual hour stirred up, In candle’s light she’s getting up.
At Verrey’s every morning’s time On credit drank three quarts of wine.
At waters shining in the still, A muse had come to me, it filled
At window alone, sad (Diana’s ray lights up, her wakens)
At window by books in heap, By bed with carpet, chairs, whip,
At window he flies was killing And daily house-keeper cursed.
At window she now sits.
At you in village have a weak But look. To listen to your speaking,
Automedones all are dashing Untiring are troikas flashing.
Away from Eugene’s lips; morose, He’s awkward, hardly has he force
Away had passed his old father, Onegin was attacked by rather
Away in lirical a heat, He cites like Delvig, drunk at feast.
A word to say, and then again To think arid think, but of the same All day and night until new meeting.
A yard boy’s running in the middle, He made his dog in sledge to sit
A young two-horned the moon at sky, But at unusual left the side,
A youth unmoving lies on it; He hears voices: ‘Well, he’s killed...’
Baratynsky.
B By pantalones, frac, gillette - In Russian they are absent yet.
Became alredy quite inapt.
Because her love is not of fashion, Obedient to the call of passion?
Because ire, truthfulness she’s swift? Because from heavens got as gift
Because of ache of own head. And, though staying rake adoring,
Because remember bitter mourning When hear noise of forest’s thicks?
Because she’s innocent and plain,
Because uncautious ardent soul Annoys, ridicules, as a whole
Because we often take the talkings For real, useful, vital things?
Because we restlessly disclose Defects; are bustling; judge the whim?
Before arrival; anyhow She isn’t bothered (that’s female!);
Before the fight to be invited... At watch, the sun he’s looking on...
Began to aim... but quickly just Onegin shot...
Be glad with such a man… You smart With rare wit your letter wrote!
Behind accacias, bird cherries From storms is hidden in his den,
Behind a stump Guillot quite scared.
Behind the grave my Lensky poor To deaf eternity was used.
Behind the mill.
Believe (for bail I give my conscience), The wedlock will be poignant nonsense.
Believe, I’d never try anew To look for better bride but. you.
Be quick, my friends! the field invites. In carts with weights of food, attires,
Besides, opinions of the husband By very good and virtuous wife
Besides, they all are so pure, Magestic, for the love unfit,
Between affairs and the leisure She found out with a pleasure
Between blancmanger and roasts fine They now bring the Tsimlyan wine.
Between the Limburg lively cheese And best pine-apple gold squeese.
Between two aunts at column now, Not seen by anyone that tame,
Bewildered and astonished hard...
Blue smoke rises to the sky, And thorough German baker goes
Boom could fade.
‘Bordeaux’ all the times!
Brothers!
But after first cordial greeting Zaretsky’s silent for a while
But aim of looks and talks on whole That time at feast are fatty pies
But all his journeys and the trips, Like all in world, began to bother:
‘But all the elegies are mere A trifle, aimless idle talk,
But all the nothern Russian summer Of south winter bad burlesque:
But all the same, the hope them With baby-talk is lying then.
But all the youngsters, always flaming, Could never enmity conceal,
But anyhow, dear reader, Alas! it was young lover’s lot:
But anyway the friend of mine To be light-hearted had been fated,
But are you listening yet to me?
But as a whole their talk Is harmless, but unpleasant mock.
But as soon as in charms of dreaming He lost himself - his neighbour comes
But at least
But at the time of cold winter The drive is pleasant all the day:
But at the window, not gay, Was mutely sitting all the day.
But, being wife, she willy-nilly Yet sighed for man of other kind,
But blessed by God of inspiration Another one in. rhymes of fashion.
But blissful husband of coquette, To part from him you did regret!
But breget bells are now clinking: New ballet will begin by chance,
But by your narrow small tracks,
But can’t: through door her Eugene enters; In front of eyes of Hades’ spectres
But can’t you really absolve Her passions, if you them revolve?
But crosses bridge; her helping her: She runs… the bear’s after her!
But dangerous for the maiden’s heart) Quite reddenning he’s missing up.
But darkish mirror can reflect The trembling moon alone yet...
But dear friends, it all is useless: If I in future won’t be
But doesn’t lade the heat of cheeks, And brighter, strickingly it heats,
‘But do you love, indeed, the other?’ -And what? -
But Eugene all the lawsuits hated With lot contented, gave all them
But Eugene’s fate for him was fair: At first by Madame he was cared,
But Eugene was beyond conception: Of course, he knew the people well,
But even such a friendship, readers, We haven’t now; each of us
But fate for us was never steady: For long we had to separate.
But foot, such small, of Terpsichore More charming somewhat is for me.
But forward, forward, you, my story!
But from. the shaggy lackey-bear She cannot get away, She flaps:
But happiness of youth has gone Like light foot-prints in fields forlone.
But he at real field of action Himself white raptured by affection
But he is stubborn: to renounce Unfit, yet hopes, hustles; bounce
But hero, I’m not wrong, Could never be like Grandison.
But he’s forgotten, and to other His bride has given all herself...
But his such sufferable shade,
But hist!
‘But how are Tatyana, neighbours, And Olga, frisky pretty girl?’
‘But how did you marry, nanny?’ -It was by wish of God.
But how greatly Tanya’s altered!
But Hymen’s troubles, griefs of mating,
But I
But I am ready to refuse As its translation isn’t easy.
But I can hardly drag my feet,
‘But I’d prefer another,
But if my wretched fate you rather Will grasp with pity little bit, You’ll never leave me such unfit.
But if the age is late and fruitless At natural turn of life for rack,
But if the morals never shifted, My love to ballets could survive.
But I… it doesn’t bother me: To old times I’ll loyal be.
But I, it may be, not adoring Will see the secrets of the grave,
But I my fruits of dreams am reading, And my harmonious ventured verse
But in a while I had been used To caustic, hot argumentation,
But in a while the guests from suburb Are making up a common hubbub:
But in gloomy cliffs
But in the parlour all are flattered By such a trifle, banal trash;
But it betrays with froth imprudent My stomack. I have never sought
But it is late, it’s time to go...
But it’s enough to speak of her:
But its magestic merry fizz Caused foolishness and some misgiving,
But I was born for peaceful living, In village stillness gladly breathe,
But jingle of the spurs he hears, Tatyana’s husband just appears,
But landlords of the country’s peasants Were never liked by him at feasts;
But Latin’s not in fashion now. To tell the truth but frank enough,
But Lensky, having no wishes Of marriage ties the weight to have,
But let it go: at this rate To strive against myself alone
But let me help with sacred water.
But l forsee some more of bounds: The honour of my land to save,
But like a house all deserted It’s dark and still, and not by chance
But liked the spirit of his judging, Judicious talks of that and this.
But many days away could get
’But may be she’s in love?’ ‘Who knows?
But may be those kinds of pictures By now can’t you all attract,
But my fate
But Nazon was by world denied And suffered past rebellious session:
But never wanted to correct; To censorship I’ll pay my debt;
But no answer...
But no man in all the district Could ever know of that fuss:
But none a thought for days is flashing; At neither random nor by chance
But none she had!
-But no one...
But now...
But nowadays... explain the gist; To feet of mine what is you leading?
But nowadays the frosts are crackling (A rhyme for cra.ckling, one foresees;
But now dear moon for us Is mere lantern in the skies.
But now doubts all are solved:
But now, friends, from all my sides -
But now - God! - is cooling blood
But now, heartily I though Do love my hero fine,
But now radiant moon’s ray Is dying out, and some quaky From earth gets out steam.
‘But now tell;’ she says, ‘to me: Whom did you see in dream with me?’
But often passions were invading The mind of hermits, of my men.
But others made him disappoint! The slow languid was the point.
But other times in mind I bear!
But people! all you are alike Your ancestor, called Eve, foremother: What’s given, hardly it involves, But constantly the Dragon calls
But persons ordinary for us Are never strange, they fit all u.0
But really?
But riot at all: like long ago For poor bard is on the watch
But road alarm of love then filled me.
But saw: annui, the rave, the harm, The fraud; nor shame, nor sense, nor charm;
But, seems to me I’d wish, of course To fill my fate with kind of glory.
But send your boy, and first of all’ .
But sequels of the sudden meeting To-day, my dear reader-friend,
But several books of common row Himself excluded from disgrace:
But shall I fall by shaft through pierced Or will it pass beside, will slip?
But shall I see you?’ - Tanya cries And sheds the tears from her eyes.
But she’s neglectful to the singing, To ringing voices of the maids,
But She whom I yet don’t dare To trouble with my lyre fair,
But simply I to you will send The legends of the Russian real
But something more us separated...
But somewhat pale and rather thin, And yet she’s looking rather slim;
But soon for husband, all at once,
But soon, not asked for her concession, Was to the altar led away.
But soon she all was full of go, By it she calmed herself at once:
But soon to farming she began To be accustomed and relying.
But stealthily the door unlocking Grey-haired nurse already’s walking, With tea on tray is coming up: -My child, it’s time for getting up; But, beauty, you are now ready!
But such amusements, yet important, Are worthy of an old ape
But suddenly could part from it, As I from my Onegin did,
But suddenly her eyelids close, She hasitates to make a step..,
But suddenly her sister’s coming, Then Lensky comes; the light has flashed;
But suddenly the wind has blown Away the lire of all lamps:
But suddenly was changed it all:
But summer’s flying quicker yet.
But talk of their dear wives By absent wit him always strikes.
But Tanya now like in dream
But Tanya’s heart yet isn’t gladdened, To meet the winter never came,
But that’s more wonderful and dreadful: A crayfish on a spider rides,
But that will do; adieu is [node: For madness tribute you have paid.
But then a frenchman took her place.
But then, amused by idle dreamings, Attended to my better feelings
‘But then... or it not true?.. in desert, From fussy rumours being far,
But then, the love of tender beauties More trusty is than friendship, kin,
But then with books she could be dealing.
But then your horse will try in fear
But they, to whom at friendly meeting My first of stanzas could I cite...
‘But they will have a throng of people And all the other rabble feeble..?.
But they would madden it too hard.
But to no person In all the world I’d give my heart,
‘But trouble is: they are such bores’.
But uncoordinated volumes From devil’s library all got,
But was delayed for short a while As they had no rings of fashion.
But was my Eugene satisfying By being free in prime of life,
But wave and stone, The ice and flame, the verse and prose
But well, its time I should be busy: The beauty’s letter I should use.
But well, she’s named Tatyana; gladless, Nor by her sister’s pretty grace,
-But what about?
But what I’d want? what task am aiming By opening my heart. to you?
-But what is it -
But what severe!
But what Tatyana could he thinking When recognized among the guests
But when her thanks for termination To Eugene came, tier languid mood,
But when his thoughts were of destroying His own rivals, though few,
But when the nurse in summer gathered To Olga all her little friends,
But when to country comes the evening The billiard, cues are left again,
But when Vladimir disappeared, Onegin, languished by the bore,
But where are you? Come! My rights
But where now he is not... And where left he dismal rot.
But where now through them speeds
But where of Melpomen heavy Resounds fine and drawling wail,
But whisper, laugh of fools can hurt..’
‘But who is she?’ She is my wife,
But who is that, in throng selected, Is standing mute and unaffected?
But whom to love?
‘But who? plump general that big?’
But why? I don’t grasp it yet). And now friends enjoy a chat..
But why, Onegin, you are yawning? -
But why Talyana should be guilty?
- But why you so indisposed Are speaking bad about him?
But will and power of mind All overcame, and she already
But will it come, my day of freedom?
But withered!
But with Tatyana shan’t we guess.
But wretched is, who’s all foreseeing, Who never felt some ache of head,
But yet not sharing with throng Ideas, passions yours life long".
But yet she can’t.
But yet to make him be at rest Of pleasures won’t be the best.
But you are pale... What are you feeling? ‘It’s nothing, nanny, not at all.
But you are tortured by the road.
But you forgive him, games in stillness!
Buyánov courted: was refused.
Buyánov, my quick-temperd brother, To Eugene brought two girls at once:
By bondage Lensky’s fascinated, Gave up his soul to the fun.
By chance his verse yet anyhow Is kept by me; you read this rhyme;
By chance I met you long ago. A spark of tenderness you showed.
By children and by loyal wife With candid never seen in life.
By clear smile the nature’s fitting Through dream the year’s morning meeting
By crimson hand not seen by now The dawn from morning towards the lay
By cunning husband he was greeted, Of Faublas previous a fan;
By deep embarrassment fulfilled She has to stop, she’s standing still.
By dreadful exclamation Onegin’s shuddered; slain, impatient
By dreams of distant pretty side, About moon and charming night...
By eager enmity exited Vladimir for the answer waits.
By fate all counted my days, All painful are they nowadays,
By fire of the praise and sighs To tempt the heart of girl yet tries:
By got by Olga strange tuition She’s touched, in depth of soul sighs;
By greyish Kalmyk: wears glasses And torn a coat, socks in hands;
By habits of the life he’s pampered, By somebody he was well tempered,
By happy force of own dreamings She brings to life all novel’s beings,
By hard from big Tambóv’s engaged; Buyhánov whirls with Pustyakóva,
By him were left at your employments.
By his anwaited apparition, By instant tenderness of eyes,
By honeyed dream he was amusing The doubts of his own heart;
By instant cool is all filled up To him Onegin hurries up,
By liars secretly prepared, By worldly mob in chorus favoured,
By lordly Byron portrait bright, By doll cast-iron and diminished
By love her grief to lull to sleep, Some uhlan could her flattered keep;
By love intoxicated, Embarrassed by the tender shame,
By many signs she’s always worried, In secret way all objects hurried
By name he was Vladimir Lensky. With Göttingen in soul frankly,
By new one can’t I be admired I pity old one - it’s true.
By night’s benevolent light breathing We mutely reveled and could fail!
By nothing bound, I’m a stranger: I thought: the freedom, peace for me
By now from a distant village The idol of the ladies ripe,
By Olga’s hand the tea’s been pouring To little cup of guest adoring By dark and sweetly scenting stream; A boy already brings the cream; At window Tatyana’s standing, She’s breathing at the cooling glass And lost in thought quite deep and vast With pretty finger she is melting On misted window’s cool pane Her pattern O.E. again.
By one mistrustful old man; Him stately cuckold admitted,
By own or by post-chase You get away from city gates.
By post-chase he headlong went, Was yawning sweetly before hand,
By prudent talk without trite, E ternal morals, prigs surviving,
By rays of day will shine the morning And brightly will be playing clay,
Byron
By sight through panes at moonlight diminish, By this quite pallid feeble light,
By sorcery of story’s secrets!
By spite of fortune and of mean, While both were beginners then.
By their poetic light He own soul did ignite.
By this half-tormenting a ramble, By table with a faded candle,
By those phantoms he, vain seeker, Should not in vain exhaust himself:
By thoughts of her each one another Unfavourably try to daze;
By turbid brooks have run all down To meadows, all under flood.
By us the habits have been got Instead of happiness from God.
By vernal rays all driven now From hills the snows, turned to mud,
By whom was tenderness inspired? - With words neglectness who’s admired?
By winter carpets, snow-made.
By worst of modes: modern fuss, Which is a tyrant for us.
By writing verse, the dismal mourner Of parents, with running eyes,
Came in.
Can daily headlong ride full speed; When she alone in the field
Can hiss; with bearings important, By couplets tortured all the time,
Can it be real that at last My youth had withered in the past?
Can it he real anyhow Without elegical deed
Can know time without fuss: The stomach is the watch for us.
Can live like real wise a ma7i: Like that Horatius with cabbage
Can press her heart, or a misfortune, That waits for her, is black, makes noise.
Can share stillness of pastimes; Long live
Can’t now blame: that dreadful time To be more honest could you dare;
‘...can’t sleep, it’s stuffy, you unclose The window and sit beside...’
Can’t wash her arms, her breast and face: Afraid she is of winter ways.
Cast-iron bridges over waters Will go like a bow wide;

Child-Harold’s copy, grim, morose To inner rooms and halls he came;
Clarissa, Julie and Delphina; Tatyana in the forest’s still
Comes in, of dead has strong resemblance.
Comes up to Olga: several jests, And they are whirling near guests.
Concerns of heart he was ignoring, He future hopes was adoring,
Conditionally by its charms Self-willed desires it alarms.
Confess; we have the taste quite mere In life, as well as in the names,
Congratulating Tanya dear With first success at fair ring
Convert the meadows to pools And bare, leafless make the woods.
Coquette is judging always coolly; Tatyana loves without jest,
Could catch a neighbour, who by chance Came in - by tragedy at once Him entertained.
Could catch the glory by the way: But I in love was dumb, inane.
Could change his soul little bit: Some virgin fire flamed in it,
Could come of such a lazy mood. He didn’t join the guild existent
Could come such proud or obedient, Could be attentive or indifferent;
Could give a fright by desperation, With flattery could draw one’s gaze,
Could grasp in idle, futile reading, Was not concerned a little bit
Could make of clever fool for ever, Explicit or implicit one.
Could me enjoy... I’ve had my fill; It is enough!
Could my Onegin now find.
Could never show shining passion, Nor sparks of poetic light,
Could not repeat, yet being shameless, That I could scribble own face
Creation of the hell or sky, This angel, haughty devil wry,
Critic strictly Demands from us: be getting rid
Dear! come to rue… As in a dream it seems to be...
Decayed...
Deceased was buried after meeting, The priests and guests were drinking, eating,
Decided is.
Delights it glorifies itself, Without love it revels self.
Departuring date again's belated And can yet run the last of dates.
Derzhavin old us was greeting, To tomb descending blessed he us.
Described for us the snowfall, {l5} The winter’s bliss and tinges all:
Deserted room alone filling You read; it’s Pradt, it’s Walter Scott.
Desires, sorrows, some dreamings In soul crowded each day.
Despite her soul, such embarrassed, Despite her passions being raised,
Devoted to childish leisure 1 hike at lake in desert nature,
Devoted to lazy feeling, With void in soul, he resstrains
Devotion to dreams unwitting, Unimitated strange unfitting,
Diana’s breasts, the cheeks of Flora Delightful are, my freinds, you see!
Did happen any bard in tears To deer love to read with fears
Did never touch hire as before, He caught the sight of nothing more.
Did not remember love and spite, Behaved like some indifferent guy
Did try to make of that some fun: The country’s freedom has its own
Directs it constantly, each minute At her, who by her own image
Distinguished: bravely to the slush From Kalmyk horse he fell in rush.
Dmitriyev.
Do comme il faut… (Shishkov, forgive; can’t some good translation give).
Does not make cows go out, And when at noon they are forlone,
Does not remove from lips his gasping Her quite insensible small hand...
‘Do not.’
Do not be angry, dear. you Well know: I am dull for you...
Do not reflect Diana’s features, Recalling bygone novel’s creatures,
D’you, Grandison in mind yet keeping?’
D’you hear?
- D’you joke -
D’you know?...
D’you see, in front of that small group The two, the uniforms they wear...
‘D’you think.’ indeed... suspicions any… But do you see...
Each box in theatre is shining, In pit each stall already boils,
Each claps.
Each day in grief of separation By fickle fate, too far from you
Each day she whispers own myths Of letter to her image dear.
Each day was shorter at the noon, The secret canopy of wood
Each man has enemies, but yet From friends defend us God a little
Each minute more is captivated By Olga’s beauty so young,
Each name from France by Russian name, Forgot princess Alina dear;
Each one by nature is restricted By contradictions in himself.
Each other day be seen I must, That I am rich in wealthy caste?
Each shutter’s open, and dry
Each topic’s argued at the meetings: To meditate they were in mood
Each year guessed for misses much: From army husbands and the march.
Effects, but stepped away anew; He’s blessed much more, who never knew
Eight years did he kill these ways, And thus he lost of prime young days.
Eloquent man, by him invited, Triumphantly the answer trails.
Embarrassment, her being tired Arosed pity, he’s admired;
Enchanting land! In days of wisdom, Of satire great potentate,
Engaged alone with accounts; Or, taking cue like somewhat armours,
Enjoyed by thunder of the music From tea with rum at once refusing,
Enough... and has been done the burden:
‘Enough, get up, I now must
Enough he fooled the whole world? At least he’d my advice have held: Refuse the modes antiquated. Enough he fooled the whole world…
Enough in common way with him We wandered in the world.
Enough, my dear...
Enough, my friend, its all the same!
Enough the boredom on the ways: The journey took them seven days.
Enrolled dandies show here The impudence and fine gillette
Enticing goblet for my love, Its you, who made me drunk with love,
Entreaties and confessions making, To speak of anything I feel,
Etcetera.
Eternal choir or the waves, To lord of world the hymn of praise.
Eugene’s letter to Tatyana
Every country eater
Exactly...
Explain to you, do it frankly.
Expresses death but not the torture.
Extinguished ash will not be heating, Without tears I am sad
Fare thee well, and if for ever 							Still for ever, fare thee well.
Feocrite, Gomer were reproved, Yet Adam Smith was well approved,
Field is clear In moonlight all it seems like silver.
Fille était fille, elle était amourese. She was a girl She was in love.
First time appeared at the rim Of outlines of my free novel.
First time indeed my muse just now To worldly rout I can lead;
Five hundred years), roads, may be, In all the state will change invently:
Fonvizin shone, a friend of freedom, Knyazhnin was always up-to-date.
For all his thoughts it was a passage - Unusual tongue of maiden’s dreams.
For all of that
For all the childish tricks felt sorry, To them was stranger; dreadful story
Forbidding goddess, guile inventive, Of reigning, sumptuous Neva fine.
For boston, lomber come in sight, For whist, well famous until now.
For centures to make him known.
For changes fated anyhow...
For coddled sense the best of pleasures: Perfume in bottles of cut glass.
For district mothers pleasant image - The regimental chief arrived.
For epigrams was always greedy With everything quite cross a Dan;
For evening party...
For evening whist who’s coming briskly, Sits down, plays not very hard,
For fair of the brides her bring,
For fantoms I my eyelids closed; But some remote dear hopes
For flirt she never gives a hint - For that high world is never fit.
For flying glory don’t long.
For garden now we shall fleet In which she’s got with him to meet.
Forgive!
Forgive me’.
Forgive me, but my love is deep To Tanya’s dear heart indeed.
‘Forgive me, ever peaceful valleys, Hill peaks well known under heavens,
Forgive me, isn’t it too hard?’ -For me it’s not - ‘But dear bard,
Forgive me thickets In which my days have passed away,
Forgive me you, my dear nature; I change my world such still and light
‘Forgive, my place, my peaceful mate!
Forgive, secluded my asylum!
Forgotten features can remind.
Forgot the town and the friends, And boredom of the festive blends.
For greetings and congratulations She gives each one her thankful look.
For her cotillion now seems Like long and heavy dreadful dreams,
For her he’s looking on... for nought...
For her the truthful sign it was That guests are coming.
For him she never will he waiting; In him she always must be hating
For him the aim of life was smart Quite puzzling riddle, much alluring,
(For him to hide was very easy By riding stallion from the Don,
For him two hearts, I can believe, Yet are in grief...
For his delight were just awaiting.
For hopes; then misunderstanding Well use to break the heart; again
For hot discussions of the gentry, The terror of the midnight sentry;
For how long?
For husband then she was yet bride.
For intricate and slander talk, In checking all my traits for mock,
For it I shall repay a lot By my admission, truly artless;
For long as if through fog she one Could follow them all with eyes...
For long by fate of Lensky, striking, Unwittingly her soul’s filled
For long has chance with us to be?
For long is weeping she this time.
For long Onegin couldn't bear That tragical and nervous mood
For long Tatyana here goes At stylish fascinating cell.
For long to hear, understand Perfections yours, all them confessing
For long to wish, your knees embracing, And weeping at your dear feet,
For love all ages are submissive But to the innocent young heart
For love she’s dedicated truly Like loyal child for mother’s nest,
For me is now hard the gladness, Not only the grief... my heart...
For merry dispute he was able To be in answers dull or sharp,
For me the glory bring, of course: Wry talks, the noise, a lot of curse!
For me your honour is the bail, I trust you bravely all my feeling...
For mill they all have had resolved At dawn in time to come in carriage
For my mistakes in Russian grammar, - Help God to find in all this book
For noise, for storms, for many feasts, For everything! For all your gifts
For noise of fuss such brilliant, bright.
For nowhere am I smart...
For pranks or weakness of the dear... (That’s all he knew in own world...)
For pranks reproved with gentle talks, To Summer Garden took for walks.
For quiet leisure after work; For lively pictures, salted word;
For Russian heart too much is fused And echoed in it through muse!
For silent room alone getting At once the whole world forgetting With nobody nearby
‘For single winter it will do, At least I’ll credit money you’…
For tears her, by will suppressed - Her heart is torn in half at breast,
For tears, rhymes and so on?… Present me her’.
For teeth the brushes, and for nails, Some thirty kinds for all avails.
For that a neighbour in his farming Was puffing up: to his big farm
For that at distance poor dwelling, For place, in which the first toy time,
For theatre Onegin’s speeding. In it each man is free at all:
For them to love yet meant to grieve, To scare males was joy for ages.
‘For the sake of goodness, You keep the eclog, now useless.
For thoughtful singing with attention?’
For us are only some tools, And all ones passionate are fools.
For us fine Hymen now makes And maybe yet for many days.
For weeks matchmaker was then coming To all my kin, and due to that
For what and where do I strive?
For words of love to be entreating, First move of heart to catch by chance,
For world has done yet nothing titling, To grow male yet hadn’t time
For you the glory and the laud, The father’s land, incarceration?
Four fatal for the life the stages...
«Freischutz» lovely tune But played by pupils in a Fume.
From archives coining several youngsters In throng at Tanya stiffly gaze,
From Bade that sceptical was reading, With works of Fontanelle was meeting.
From bed Onegin wasn’t moving, The dream yet flies about him.
From bed to icy bath had fallen And afterwards was whole days
From cold world of dissipation To fade away not having time,
From early times he was dissembling, Some hidden hope he could leave,
From Eugene differ I my image, To note this I always trend,
From everything to me legated, I had my heart for ever torn;
From glass not stopping For a while’. He never kisses hands of ladies,
From here, deeply lost in thought, He looked at threatening flame he got.
From morning forth I must be sure, That I shall see you just to-day.
From mountains descends this way
From novel’s only beginning — I’ve finished now chapter one.
From pistol he, not being rattled, At fifteen metres stuck the ace.
From Romul to the present day - In depth of mind he kept away.
From saucers, filled with clear waters Some rings get out as on trotters
From them: she new blazes greatly, She feels herself in passion badly;
From two to thirty years on; The district dandy Petushkóv,
Gets out, asks for own horse And rides.
Give arguments, but I do not: To quarrel ages don’t want.
God knows, whom by words you dart; Of elegies the precious code
Good-bye, the witness of past glory, Petrovsky castle.
Good guy and sergeant of the guards, This Grandison could play the cards.
Good heavens! Never did she shudder! Nor sudden paleness, redness has...
Goodness me!
Goodness me, it isn’t For him to hear!
Go on!
Grandchildren once upon good day Will press from world all us away.
Grandfathers to the tombs do press, It comes, the time of exitation,
Grand treaty’s ditties exercise; The foes stand and drop the eyes.
Great charm to any conversation.
Green tables are prepaired now, All active players they invite:
Grey-haired couple of Scotinin With all the children you’d be seeing
Griboyedov
Gvozdin, good master, who could shortly Make beggars of his peasants fast.
Half-aireal and resplended, To magic bow all attended,
Haphazard wander to prevent.
Has been enlivened all the talk; In front of hostess light rot
Has breathed, has wailed; from nothern shelf Enchanting winter comes herself.
Has brought. the sun and anyhow The merry festival name-day .
Has come; to servant says he will Lepage’s fatal barrels steady
Has fallen…
Has found end untimely hard!
Has mined great life-giving voice, And after funeral sad habit
Has own place to have a rest, From porch to maiden’s.
Has withered at the morning dawn., The fire at the altar’s gone.
Have been decayed in nature’s train Like leaves in autumn, full of rain.
Have less in difference between Each one.
He aimlessly began to wander, With passions only agrees,
Healthy all...
He bowed. Unattending body, At stage he looked as if by chance,
He brought from Germany his dear, As poet, of learning fruits,
He calmly sleeps in bed, retired From pastimes, flourishing big child.
He came, What news, such sentimental!
He can’t endure such a blow; The whims of women he can curse.
He can’t give happiness at large’.
He cast a glance at ladies’ tires, At circles but with looks, attires
He ceased to fall in love with beauties And dangled after like the rest;
He ceased to like (with them was led) Invectives, sables and the lead.
He comes: the corks for ceiling pass, The wine like comet splashes fast.
He comforts her in all her griefs And constantly with her he sleeps.
He could his feelings there show But not to bristle like a beast.
He couldn’t be a bard for ever, He didn’t go mad or die,
He curses all unbidden guests; And half alive she can’t have breath..
He, dandy in his prime, approves All Kant’s ideas and his moves.
He did believe, that soul dear Will join enevitably him,
He didn’t want by any way But by the rules of artful fashion,
He didn’t want to cheat meanwile The trusting heart of pure being.
He died at hour of dinner, Bermoned by his neighbours dear,
He differed people in effect, And other’s passions could respect.
He doesn’t gather them with horn. A maiden’s singing in her house,
He doesn’t go, ready now To write to ancestors: to hail
He for meeting Arrived; is coming... just has got
He found house full of servants; To see deceased, from any sides
He gave his hard; in all her grievance (As they would say, it was unwitnessed)
He had of books, as no harm In them he saw, but no charm
He has a trouble from the feeling Of spook of unreturning day.
He hasn’t any fascinations, But has some snake of recollections,
He hurries up to live, As well as he does to feel.
He hurries up to ring.
He isn’t here...
He isn’t more… The youngling bard
He is seeking New ways. The second day, the third
He is suspending This quite unpleasant tete-a-tete.
He joked in a funny manner, Could fool an idiot for fun,
He kept me often in his hands, While I could show many pranks
He knew the Latin anyhow: To talk about epigraf,
He laughs - they all are laughing further: He frowns - all are srient, wry.
He left with real consolation Of woods and valleys isolation,
He liked the grove’s timid thickness,
He liked the stillness, lone mood, The night, the stars, the round moon.
He’ll fascinate you, I am sure, By picturing in flaming verse
He’ll never hear hymn of times, The blessing of the future tribes.
He looked for girls without passion And left them all with none compassion,
He looks al her with tender ardour; He’s yet beloved with previous force,
He looks and sees: the time is high Away from yard for mill to fly.
He looks, he calls him - all’s for nothing!
He loved the method with his passion: To make a man on earth to lay
He made me love him with insistence And couldn’t find some better test.
He makes a sign and all they bother; He drinks and all they drink and cry;
He may each entrechat catcall, Or hiss Moina, Fedra greeting;
He, might be, for the world’s welfare Or even for the fame was born;
He mutely bowed to the girl, His gaze somehow was in all
He never wished to rummage quickly In chronological thick dust
He now leaves the noisy rout. He goes home, has to think;
He offers necessary service And dressing-gown puts on him.
He opened a door."
He pined away, he was dissuading, Was dull and jealous, made believe;
He puzzled over effect, In it could miracles suspect.
He quickly sleepy was from them, And grasped all clearly by then:
Her belt of silk she is removing, Undressed is going to bed,
Her breast as yet is greatly trembling,
Her chest is high, her cheeks are covered By instant flame, they quickly flowered,
Her dream is sinister, it all At sad adventures pointed out.
He real bard resented there, When all alone, lost in haze,
Her easy dreams by other dreams; As well as trees can change the leaves
‘Here’s He! that’s Eugene!
Her face but has of wrath a track...
Her father was good-humoured being, From age retarted. Scornful feeling
Her grief she never hides And lone in the woods she hikes."
Her head; is seeming to be ready For deep a faint, this being mild;
Her head to shoulder’s inclining, Her light chemise is now sliding From charming shoulder away...
Her husband comes.
Her husband’s love to wife was hearty, Her deeds he took for mere crank,
Her letter of unwitting kind By love of innocence is breathing.
Her love but fright nevertheless, Main person of this novel pretty!
Her maiden’s mirror yet she keeps.
Her movements were unhurried, slow. Nor cool, nor talkative is, though
Her neck was caught by long a bough, Then branches could her ears meet
Her own house they have come; The door wide open was done
Her real doubt Zadeka never could resolve!
Her role how firmly played,
Her Russian was yet very bad As Russian books she never read.
Her secret heat, of which she dreamt, Whose plenitude ih heart she felt.
Her soul managed to engage; And near him Tatyana seeing
Her spirit longed for fatal food; Long since unbearable anguish
Her summer shoes quite wet through all; Then she her handkerchief lets fall.
Her tender fingers didn’t dare To take a needle; she could never
Her thought is hiking everywhere, Forgotten are the bail, the world.
Her tired look and slipped away...
He rules her, but neglectly gliding, And, bending, whispers her his finding:
Her way is crossing, then she feels Herself embarrased; and of tears,
Her young and dear, pretty, charming, Her confidante, her near darling
He’s always frowned, taciturn, He’s chilly, jealous, angry turned!
He sang of how life could fade; All that in his teenage he made.
He sang of love, for love was loyal, His song was clear like the noon,
He sang of partings and of griefs, Of something, foggy misbeliefs,
He saw in it some dreadful harm; The other smiled, but smile was cunning;
He’s blessed... But may be she has been Amused by other, not by him.
He’s blessed, who feast of life was leaving In time, not drinking to the end
He’s blessed, who in his youth was youthful! He’s blessed, who well in time was ripe.
He’s blessed, who with his love combined
He sees some smelted snow; now, As if he sleeps in some doss-house,
He’s handsome, rich, of fair manner. And neighbours said: he needs a bride.
He’s happy now just to throw On shoulders her fluffy wrap,
He’s hiking. Never, I believe, He has been bothered that I grieve.
He shouts: ‘Stop your own crying And croaking the same, and whining,
He showed tenderness. Such start Enlivens poor Tama’s heart.
’He’s ignoramus’, said the neighbours, ’He is free-thinker, drinks red wine
He’s killed!..
He’s killing Lensky; horrid shading Lays down, then a dreadful cry
He’s languished by the hits rebuffing, Attentive in the still and noise
He slept and coffee had he here, His menager’s reports could hear,
He’s not a fool; Onegin, grudging, Did not respect the heart of his;
He’s not been seen, none word from dear;
He’s now languished by remorse, He’s being ready to beg pardon,
He so used to live in visions That he could go mad quite free
He speeds her up the forest road; Through trees is seen a dwelling old,
He speeds through Petersburg, all restless, Awoken by drums’s beat.
He’s puffing, he is remonstrating, He swore to devil Lensky’s head For sufferings, he here had.
He’s rumbling, quickly he gets up, For door he nears, ail got up.
He stepped away... he turned a bit..’-
He’s trembling, loses fitting words, He’s happy, has improved his health,
He’s very glad that former pass He changed for anything at last.
He thinks of here:
He thought: a fool would trouble his Such quickly fading high affection,
He thought she would be much confused, By his arrival much abused;
He, touching witness, captivated By childish prettiness of games
He trembles... to princess he’s coming; His Tanya lone he is finding_
He tried, but of the work persistent He felt yet sickness. Nothing good
He tried his cooling word to own, To keep away from man like this;
He under chest was wounded here, The blood yet steaming flew at ease.
He wanted to establish own, In orders newer fashioned line:
He was a common Russian barin, Was kind and good; at his remains
He was afraid of being answered
He was beloved.., at least was grateful To have such hope like a balm.
He was enabled, slightly rushing, To speak of anything at once,
He was in dances quick and light, Without tension he could bow:
He was mistaken: sleeping fair — Onegin then for world was dead,
He was to blame at times more thickly: At first, he wasn’t right at all
He would have known life quite real, At fourty gout would have had,
He writes of all that he can hear Or see of Olga in the near,
Him call to sit to samovar, And Doonya quickly gives him tea,
Him nothing there can alarm, The world for him is shut dud dumb?
Him scenting, horses on the road All snort, and travellers quickly hold:
Himself consoled if not suited, Betrayed - was glad to have a rest,
Himself should show as the hard Without prejudices heading
His ardent talk was full of haze;
His conscience Lensky was revealing, His own soul criticized.
His epigram’s unwaited file Could make all pretty ladies smile.
His everyday employments rather In details I should well describe.
His eyes the books were reading, But all his thoughts were far away;
His father didn’t understand Arid put in pledge the whole land,
His father served for many years, And fell in debt, such big and vast,
His French was so perfect now, That he could chat, as well as write,
His friends arrived like vile observers Who come to funerals all times.
His geese and ducks tie breeds for fee And teaches children ABC.
His genius was unique, alone, He knew of something best of all,
His heart is pressed, fulfilled with bore,
His heart, Vladimir qickly penned At tomb a madrigal by hand.
His heart was sad, his voice was mournful.
His horse the snow feels at present, Its trotting, lazily away.
His house stood in place selected, From winds by mountains protected,
His illness never was distinguished From illness, known so far,
His letter’s here, quite exact.
His life’s monotonous and is mixed, The same for many days is fixed,
His life was calm, without woe. Sometimes his neighbours in his home
His look was always quick and tender,
His lunch him answered with politeness.
His lyre, now mute, could dare Alarm a loud peal for long,
His misty, foggy gaze
His morbid and quite dying look,
His nets for them were so frightening!
His nose, shoulders could raise The general, by her amazed.
His Olga’s jumping from the porch Like feather-brained and trail a hope:
His own tender verse he leaves Like monument to his affections,
His own works?
His passions were too quickly cold, And he was bored by worldly noise;
His pen with love is always sighing Without coolness of the wit:
His pistol then Onegin raises
His scandal talks were such backbiting!
His servant Guillot from France, is running in,
His sharp, but somewhat cooling wit.
His soul’s warmed with inspiration By lady’s greetings, friendly kind.
His style to pompous tune rerversing An ardent author tried sometimes
His temper, in his chair sitting, And aims to own each other’s brains;
His verse is sluggish and obscure (It’s called romanticism by us;
His wife herself such feeling had: From Richardson to be quite mad.
His wig yet smoothing by his hand Of her inquires old man.
His wish to sacrifice his fate; But for the end (to make impression)
His wit of poet was milding; His constantly inspired faze, -
H’m, h’m! You, generous my readers, Are all your kinsfolk o’key?
Hor
How would you not love Moscow?
Hurra! we all have reached the land.

Iambus he, at frank confession, From trochee couldn’t tell meanwhile.
I am engulfed by trembling vice: An epigram is being ready
I ask: be patient for a time;
I…’ -But you are boring
I can foresee: you’ll be abused By sad and secret explanation.
I cannot show to the end As I must go after speaking
I can’t foresee any objection To this representation made.
I can’t I am at will your own And I give up to all my fate.
I can your frankness estimate, It made my feelings agitate
I checked it all, and very strictly; In many places contradictory,
I could define
I’d cheer up imagination By picture where love yet strives.
Ideal image, Tanya’s rhyme...
I didn’t dare to believe: Cave no start to habits dear,
I’d like anew to warn all you: You, mothers, should be more severe,
I’d like to use the Alban’s model: In Petersburg to show ball.
I don’t grasp despite endeavours; You listen to (if I am right?)
I don’t grudge: why should I grudge?
‘I don’t hamper you, but dear, For evenings where have you gone?
I don’t like the Russian speeches Without grammar incompleteness, As well as lips without smile.
I don’t mean to please grand people.
I do remember them; in dream They trouble all my heart, such grim.
I dread: in my submissive prayers You’ll see by strict, severe gaze
I dread to read again...
If by my lot I were convicted A husband, father just to be,
If by the family best vision For instant I’d be charmed with reason,-
‘I fell in love’, again she whispers In nurse’s ear in dismay.
‘I fell in love... you’d get away
If I had any hope rigid Not often, mere once a week,
(If I had right for some decisions) I would prefer to slighting feelings,
If I were poet like you.
‘If I would wish to have restricted My life by family, you see,
If mincing cat, on stove sitting, While purring could his muzzle wash,
If not... if not, let God deliver!
If she’s seeing
If that Fillidae you can show, The subject for the pen to mourn,
If their district visits on?
If you could know, what’s diminished To languish in the thirst for love,
I grasp its vanity, and never Too much I was attached to it;
I had happened To know many old legends,
-I hate your world of fashion marbles, Much more I like the world indoors,
I haven’t force... is tired breast…
I have without any doubts Tatyana’s letter to translate.

I — It sparkles by Hippocrene’s role, It was by own play and foam
I keep in mind the sea, quite stormy: What envious I was when waves
I knew some difficult young ladies' Like winter cold, pure, light,
I know: Parny’s tender rhymes Make no hit at present times.
I know, you were sent by goodness, You’ll be my guard until the end,
I lagged behind as their member And ran away...
I last and poor mite was giving For you myself, remember this;
I liked his features in the past:
I like teenage’s lively madness, The tightness, brightness and the gladness;
I like the friendly idle speakings And friendly howl of sweet wine
I live and write not for applause,
‘I’ll be defender; I’ll not endure when offender
‘I’ll perish, - says my Tanya’s voice - From him to die is pleasant fortune.
I’ll simply say without fevers: If previous idol I could find,
I’ll take a look and then turn’,
I loved you, I for love had hunger, But what in all your heart could find?
I love him, he’s my kin in-law.
I love you, but with love of brother And may be tenderer indeed.
I love you (why should I be cunning?).
Imagine: I’m alone, thus From no man have understanding...
I’m free, but look for union, geared In sound, sense and temper game/
-I’m glad. - ‘but when?’ -Well, now just, They will receive with pleasure us.
I’m greatful for the good enjoyments, For sadness, for the pretty torments,
I’m hiking round pretty lake, Some flocks of ducks by chance awoke,
I might be deeply loving you, But getting used I’d run from you;
Immense and light, at distance waiting; Through glasses old people guess
‘I’m neighbour just’.
‘I’m not quite made to be much happy. My soul’s alien for bliss;
Implacable at their ages, Inscrutable for all my mind;
Importantly repeats for doll The mother’s lessons, though small.
Impossible!?
I’m sorry that you go… well, My dear Lensky, will you tell,
I’m unknown...
In actions husband’s mutilated, And us for that at court caress?
In Africa; at any step To sigh about mirky Russia,
In afternoon they squash and crowd, In drawing room they meet new face;
In all her charms, to steppes yet bound, I can with jealous shyness poop.
In all of them restriction’s queer; Antiquity the old backs.
‘In all the world its most badly To see in family the wife
In book’s short contents, finds she out Some words that should explain about
In brackets I would like to note: You haven’t more insulting lie,
In brackets to the point I’d note: In all my verses, by my rhyme
Incautious, likely, I was, but me could supplicate
In cold heart is kindling blood... Again the grief, of love the flood!
In coolness of the gloomy grove With purl and babble of still streams,
In country lyre is more ringing, More vivid are creative dreams.
In country’s place the man of wisdom, He gave his serfs a piece of freedom:
In country tedium’s prevailing Without palaces or streets,
In crowd everybody renders:
In dark my Tanya’s quite upset With nurse in whisper has a chat:
In days of gaiety and wishes I could at ballets lose my wit;
Indeed, by magnetism’s all forces The mechanism of Russian verses
Indeed, d’you have this kind of mate Destined to your severe. fate?
Indeed, for long should have the end!
Indeed, he’s blessed, the lover tranquil, Who can explain his own dreams
‘Indeed? - my Eugene’s now thinking, - But is it true?..
Indeed she now could behave Indifferently, could be brave?
Indeed, you won’t With all your pure flaming heart
In deserts of the heaven’s districts, The goddess of the sighs and secrets.
Induce to have a stop, inviting In front of their charms to kneel.
In duels classic, pedant cross
In early spring of every year.
In eastern comfort being cherished Sad northern snow to embellish.
In epigrams it. would be fitting...). But let’s return to lady sitting.
I never wished with such a torture To kiss young Armid’s pretty lips,
In eyes with dismal thought of brains, Arid with a book in French in hands.
In fear I was crying, darling,
In fear shameful heart is sinking.
In flame by wit to cool each minute The agitation in the blood;
In form of merry, pretty jest With somewhat ruse, to have the breast
In France of cooking highest gauge; And pie train Strassburg, freshly driven,
In front of darkened silent homes, Along the sleepy streets in rows;
In front of flaming fire-place Was Benedetta purring fair
In front of him gay fancy’s giving His Pharaoh, and tries to fit;
In front of tenderness quite plain, In front of soul playful, frail...
In front of them when they were near White-stone Moscow they saw:
In front of you in pangs to stand, To pale, to fade... That is the blessing?
In front of you with signs of death Is stiffening slowly, is cooling,
In fruitless speeches drily fuse inquiries, some gossips, news,
In gallery the claps are flying, And rising curtain makes a noise.
In games with doll can train for mild Decorum of the loyal living:
In general he gave them hell, But any rule has some exception:
In great confusion she is hastening, While falling star yet isn’t fading,
In grief of love Tatyana goes To their garden, she is sad;
In hands I have Tatyana’s letter. It’s kept by me with sacred sigh.
In hands my fate for ever now, In front of you I tears shed: Defend my soul anyhow...
In happy heat on moral lecture By chance could give her like preceptor?
In Harold cloak, hat with brim, Or other whims interpretation?
In haze are now minds of people: The moral them to sleep just makes;
In heaps, forgotten in the streets.
In hearty letter, as its sender, He was slipshod.
In her could never find a hook To use the word on fashion’s duty,
Inheritage, he had by then, Not seeing loss in all, he wasted
In his first youth he was untrained,
In hope that by future friend Of me some sound will be said.
In horror Tanya is awaking...
In house-keeping he was best Arid any problems put to test:
In icy bottle for the poet Sometimes is brought at proper time.
In it a friend of joys quite virgin Could bless the sky if cast a look.
In it immersed, he there quite The whole world again denied,
In it, in spite of rules of spelling Excessive verse, as they are telling,
In it, sometimes, on rare sundays At window, in glasses, he
In languish of the heart remorses He pressed his pistol in his hand,
In languish of the loving bounds He’s spending now day and night.
In languish of unwitting pities Onegin quickly at her feel is...
In late of evening, such amusing, Along the Petersburg high-way,
In letters though he again
In life with us like new it’s hiking, And hardly will it have good fate.
In man’s attire all arrayed, The goddess comes to masquerade.
In many trends he’d change his habit: Would part with muses, would be married,
In noise of world and in the still Disturb my soul’s quiet dream.
In one he saw of brandies order, In other found debit book,
In open light dress comes out, At moon her mirror’s aiming down,
In order that derisive reader, Or any editor, too eager
In own dreams all’s being lost For long Tatyana goes forth.
In own family she was Like strange a girl in thoughts quite lost;
In own village to appear New landlord in a droshky came,
I now see, of it confessing, That even my such poor style
In paper cap for each of us To open his wasistdas.
In pocket he, as Frenchman real, Has brought for his Tatyana dear,
In pride they were with males indifferent. At distance stayed from praise and sighs.
In proud, touching inflammation Is blushing crimson.
In sadness he it all was reading, At once he hurried for the meeting,
In shade of branch some simple cross On grave of dear, poor nurse.
In shade of old trees protective, He was in games her mate effective.
In shade of two pine-trees quite old; Inscription can to you explain:
In single image they confused, In one Onegin all were fused.
In sledge he’s sitting now. -Away, away! - the driver marks,
In slow gait, quite fast and smoothly Have come the fourth already step.
In snow-drifts in front of maiden A stream is boiling, all is raging,
In songs could proudly retain For all his life exalted passions
Inspired, I again shall feel you, Your magic voice for me awaits!
In spite of Foebus warning notes Myself I’ll humble to the prose, When novels in the old ways
In spring at grass and so forth, At iron fire-place in winters,
Instead of praise he gets yet griefs: Alone under Finnish heavens
Instead she sees unknown yard, The fence, the kitchen, mews, a cart.
In stillness of the humble grove Of innocence some charming loom,
Insults all proud paltry males: The wit them presses, needs a space?
In summer Eugene lived like hermit: Past six was getting up in hamlet,
In sunny rays all sparkling, shining A block of snow hardly sliding.
Insurgent youth is not yet endless. When Eugene was to change his sort
In talks all’s plain, its all indifferent, Yet slander they without interest;
In Tanya’s, Olga’s rooms all maidens Already happy dreams have had;
In tears women have embraced And exclamations have been raised.
In tender manner they agree.
In them he draws the country whole, The Kyprid’s temple, graves alone:
In them I’ll write of simple speeches Of dad, of uncle, old man:
In them I marvelled at the virtue And fashioned arrogance, that hurts you,
In them in stillness of the day He real tears could expose;
In them reflects the whole age And modem man of nowadays
In them you can’t see any changes, They keep in patterns old gap:
In this a dirty pool with you, My friends, I have a bath like you.
-In this I see yet no troubles…
In thoughts her face too pale he found, She often seemed to be cast down;
(In times, by thorough foundation Of philosophical best rates,
In times of hopes, tender sadness, Monsieur was driven from the court.
Into the box; he now bristles; Undressed, he took some Shiller’s work.
In turn to girl were all returning With love to feet to lay themselves.
In vain I try to be aware,
In village cuckold but good, In wadded overall with hood
In village, in forgotten stillness Of you I’d never know, thus I wouldn’t know tortures sleepless.
Invitations for a meeting?
In wadded jacket and kerchief The old woman with grey hair.
In weep my plait was then undid, With songs to altar us could lead.
In what a waste, when? where? how? You, madman. will all them forget?
In which a bloody, dreadful shade To him appeared every day.
In which for winter had a place. Storm windows, the fire-place
In which 1 loved and suffered hard, And where buried I my heart.
In which they all are cursing me; Some kinds of madrigals, not oral,
In which yet streams the clear brook, To flowers, to all the novels,
In winter darkness of the night Was captivating heart and mind.
In winter here they had dinner With Lensky, neighbour late, as rule...
In winter, when the night’s weak shade
In wonder style To every place he came in time.
In young sad soul’s aspirations; And yet much more with dismal passions
I prize my hours, my days: But I’m in idle boredom wasting
I saw myself in cherished dream
I saw, Onegin, you in life. For cemetry, eternal setting
Is being deaf and dumb at all To sad and desperate your call?
Is brought a long way off by fate, They must for ever separate.
Is cunning liric, who can render
Is drawn, in turn I’ve bad nay time.
‘I see, in world you’ve been too rare...
I see: my age is short: to cure My life for every other day,
I see you strong already!
Is flying from the waxy cell.
is going, and when she’s trying To turn aside... is coming up
Is he a parody not yet?
Is heard; the dwelling all is shaking...
Is he the same or quiet now?
I simply wrote Of idle, blackish dreams of mine;
Is it because in higher circles
Is it high time as I forgot
Is it not
Is not it so, friend?
Is pictured rather well correctly With his immoral soul wry,
Is really the secret’s found?
Is sad of passions dead a track; This way the storms of autumn coolness
Is she the same Tatyana real? To whom he privately, in haze,
Is spoiled by old duels fan, He’s evil, gossip, talking man...
Is time: all good but lazy-bone Epicurean wise all men,
Istómina’s in front of pit, With nymths she waits to make a hit.
I stop!
Is waiting for the end of dance, And for cotillion her invites.
Is whitening on Lukérya Lvovna, The same yet lies Lytibóv Petróvna.
Italian nights I shall adore.
It all is still.
It all was simple: floors of oak, Divan, the table, large wardrobe,
It came, it scattered, it is hanging On boughs of the oak-trees;
It caught him now and for ever; But yet to kill himself he never,
It could be known by the nurse But slow-witted all she was.
It happened: late at time of leisures Two girl-friends, both yet teen-agers
It happened. When thunder of mazurka came,
I thought that time: will do, perhaps; But what d’you think? again collapse!’
It hurts, he laughs, through window-panes At him his mother’s finger shakes.
It in strain
It is benevolent, releasing, Like vernal storms in fields make start
It is forgivable.
It is predicting to my gazing Reward, which I can’t be appraising,
(It is the same for people simple) To curse him tried this way and that.
It lies like carpets, white and waving, Among the fields, around hills.
It looked for him through all his life Like own shade or loyal wife.
It may be, with itself has carried Some sacred secret; evil choice
It means: my noon has come, its needed For me to realize, I see.
It means the following thing mainly:
It might he other: he’d he having Some common, plainful, simple lot:
It now; but ‘Bordeaux’ prudent To-day to others nave prefered.
It’s all decided (it’s my version) By heavens board: I’m yours at heart.
It’s better place for passing letters fit.
It’s both harmful and absorbing.
Its dark.
It’s dark in valleys.
It seems to him like something awful To her remind all evening gaps.
It seems to me, my wit is fading And silently I perish must.
It serves him right: to think if strictly, If secret judge for him to call,
It’s getting dark; already, shining, Is hissing evening samovar, It heats the tea-pot, brought from China; Light steam is whirling so far.
Its here: take it and be ‘tackling’ !) All look like silver snowy fields...
It shows traceries affective, Informs of mind’s the secret backs.
It’s in the backwoods and it all Is bound by the snow-fall,
It’s late.
It’s late, the time has gone; his letter To rue was brought; the whole matter
‘It’s mine!’ the voice of Eugene thunders! And all the gang has vanished fast.
Its morning: everyone again Is up. To her it’s all the same.
It’s mute for ever all at once.
It’s nice by epigram audacious To make erroneous foe mad,
Its nicer, friends, much more when he Is wailing foolishly: its me!
It’s nice to see when stubborn gracious He bends his horns to butt is apt,
It’s right.
-it’s right, but may be you will show The pipe, the dagger and the man;
It’s right, of course, but trends of fashion, But of the nature willful pressure,
Its sad to think, indeed, that vainly The youth was given to all us,
‘It’s seven soon, it’s time to wake, Onegin, may be, has to wait’.
It’s signed by t.a.v.
It’s striking ten; he’s driving out. He’s flying... now he’s at porch.
Its time for dinner, Guests have had
Its time! - I everyday appeal.
It’s time, its time to marry her!
«It’s time to change them in a body,
It’s time to leave for life the tight
Its true, he is unknown version, But really he's honest person!’
It’s true, that all we live in ages, When rather boring is high call.
It’s true; to you I had boon listening, In stillness spoke. you to me
Its window is brightly shining, Inside much noise and fuss they’ve had;
It’s winter!..
Its worth of fine and charming soul,
It Tanya knew of near duel, At least the day before had heard
It was an honourable, pleasant A challenge, or cartel quite short,
It was because of cousin dear: In Moscow princess Alina
It was neglected., large in gauge, Of dryads shelter for an age.
It was polite and not discrepant: For duel Lensky called, in short.
It was the art of tender passion, By Nazon brightly glorified.
It was well known friendly wellcome:
It will sometime all us illume, Will gift the world some blessed perfume.

I’ve been deprived of that; I race, At hazard after you I’m dangling:
I’ve heard some voice of new desire, I’ve got new sorrow anew;
I’ve read it up:

Iván Petróvich’s fool and bore, Semyón Petróvich stints yet more;
I wait: with glance when you approach Some hopes give to poor heart Or heavy dream you stop by hard Alas! deserved by me reproach.
I was embittered, he… unfit.
I was his friend some while ago.
I was in love with it sometimes, But soon was bored by pretty creatures.
I was taking you in hands!
‘I weep... If that your Tanya old Till now you could not forget,
I would with joy allow To give this masquerade by now,
I write, and heart yet isn’t boring, The pen unwitting isn’t drawing
I write it, as for long my time I haven’t any sin of mine.
I write to you - what more or other To add to all by this is said?

Like Byron, poet of grace. Or it’s impossible or faithless
Like convict in the stocks from jail If brought to forests while he’s sleeping,
Like crank by chance at feast enormous He’s angry.
Like drunkard tight by real Frenchmen Was captivated (dear lot!).
Like great Chadayev, Eugene dear Of jealousy reproach feared,
Like Harold Child Onegin’s fallen Into the thoughtful lazy haze:
Like Harold, Quaker will he fit? Like hypocrite or other fig?
Like heat are shining crosses dear; They guilded cupolas adore.
Like he, she was well-dressed, in fashion, In best attires every day;
Like idol, - you, Omir divine, - For three millenniums in line,
Like in a dreadful misty dream Against each other in the still
Like in van Dick’s Madonna finness, Her face is round, red, she’s boon
Like Julie’s lovers, grand Wollmar, Malek-Adel and De Linar,
Like life of bard, such simple, honest, Like kiss of love at dawn of day;
Like London dandy, well arrayed, First coming to the world he made.
Like long before make heart my tremble And all my soul always flirts.
Like North Aurora’s face of her, And like a butterfly she flutters.
Like prisoner from any chain Is ready to escape again,
Like senseless rhymes of stylish In winter’s even every way.
Like shade she aimlessly is hiking And comes into deserted park...
Like thoughts of simple lady’s soul, Like dreams of child, or like the moon
Like tiresome a rank of ghosts, In face has loftiness or spleen?
Like victim under charming veil.
Like women, books were all left here,
Like young Lenore under noon With me was riding like a loom.

Night sentries, far from one to other, In stillness called each one another;
‘No’.
Nomadic life to better know, Herself with them could wild she go,
None soul’s seen in rooms at entrance...
Nor ballets, cards, nor verse one meets.
Nor by her pleasant ruddy freshness She’d catch one’s eyes by simple face.
Nor foreign beauties so fine, Nor sciences, nor evening parties
Nor longest years of the partings, Nor all to muses given time,
Nor makes get up without choosing.
Nor pictures nor a wisdom thought That Virgin or Racine had got,
Nor Scott, nor Byron, nor Seneka; The Lady’s Fashion Journal had
Nor sharpness, nor some sign of mind, Nor of communal life succession;
Nor tubes of stylish expert-men From stalls and boxes ever then.
No should disarm him long ago, That young a soul.
Not...
Not any man can grasp such things; Ignorance many troubles brings’
Not a word can slip
Not by the post-chaise, by jade, And my Tatyana was enjoying
Not Eugene he’s at most?
Not far from Tanya, young and grieved, My dear dreamer quite respondent;
Not flaming boy for fighting fit But male with honour and the wit.
Not grasping ways to understand
Not having any higher passion To rhymes to dedicate his life,
Not long ago they like brothers Divided meals, ideas, flood
Not madrigals my Lensky’s writing In Olga’s album, and indeed
Not secret tortures of the evil Would I in prose represent,
Not seeing any use of porches Through chink she now stilly watches;
(Not speaking of the verses frames). The education can’t adhere
Not stopping coming in advance, The first of them to catch a chance.

Of any ink not any spot, In room two cupboards they had got:
Of art high muses fine impressions He, happy, never put to shame,
Of ballet’s noises being tired, Transforming morning into night,
Of bard the memory itself Like smoke at blue sky is rather...
Of beauties light and fine attires, Of people variegated choirs,
Of boasting moustached young guards Who conquered pretty ladies’ hearts.
Of bold children’s secret meetings That near lime at brook began.
Of British muse some old fables Her dreams disturb, and it enables
Of Buchars, sledges, kitchen-gardens, The merchants, peasants arid the huts,
Of city dandies, maidens rich To catch the eyes derisive, rating
Of ‘Clicquot widow’ or ‘Moet` Some blessed and fine the dry white wine
Of common thinking, somewhat thoughtful,
Of Corneille stately genius; there Was known prickly Shakhovskoy
Of course, for times you have been seeing A country maiden’s album big,

Of course, it would be so bold, Describing is what I must hold.
Of course, of him I’ll quickly know,- For him I now haven’t time.
Of course, Onegin’s not alone, Who saw her disarray in eyes,
(Of course you him alredy met;) And counsellor retired Flyánov,
Of daily troubles.

Of dear friends a pretty chat.
Of dreadful fancy all the meanings Tatyana wants to find the end.
Of droshky light, remote noise From Million street was heard.
Of elegy’s bad garland quickly; To all the rhymers, friends indeed,
Of enemy from pistol parried.

Of hope, enmity and love, The blood was boiling, life could laugh.
Of how state itself enriches, And how lives, which way and why
Of humble girl some secret love?
Of ill princess the joy, caresses Are touching Tanya, but she feels

Of lofty thoughts, of simple things.
Of looking back she doesn’t dare And hurries up, she’s quickening steps,
Of loos, friends and lover-maids The voice is fading.
Of love mad sufferings she’s feeling . Without ceasing for a while
Of many kin suspicious gaze, Of husbands friendship’s heavy haze?
Of men, whom I can’t judge for long, As I myself to them belong.

Of old Kremlin keys to give; But didn’t come at all to him
Of old times the heat of feeling, May be, could capture for a while;
Of other, old, better spring, And all the heart it is alarming
Of others victories and own The pranks, the hopes and the dreams.
Of own life he could forget!
Of pale and foggy, sleepy moon The lazy East is yet asleeping, -
Of partings, jealous indignation, Of tears of conciliation;
Of passions press at last escaping, Again Onegin said of them
Of poet, who’s anyhow Convicted to the truthful love:
Of praised grandfather’s old age: The Lovelace fame is now rottened
Of proud ladies yet she slips, She now looks, but stilly sits,
Of puffing to my face the spring In bosom of the country’s still!
Of rhymes the fever: he could double Of poetry sacred scraps,
Of Russian Terpsichore’s dear
Of Russian works he something read, Rejecting nothing for effect;
Of sad misgivings she is full, Foresees misfortunes as a rile.
Of saint fulfilled generous dreams,
Of sense precautions never heeding, To her glass porch too close speeding,
Of sleepless nights, of inspirations,
Of sorceresses words and peep Delusive are... as their feet.
Of State the envoy always spoke About needs, the State had had;
Of stylish words some ready set?
Of tears tracks?..
Of that two words I must be speaking: Of young my friend I’m now singing,
Of theatre strict legislator, Inconstant adorer of later
‘Of them my Olga is the younger.
Of them some queer clown dismal Her found almost ideal
Of thoughts dead capital again To raise from dead you’ll give a hope;
Of three kibitkas transport own Can bring belongings of the home:
Of tortures full, her heart refuges The hopes of her heavy dream.
Of traitresses quite young at all, Of mates despised a circle close;
Of trusting soul hard confessions, Of pure love such good expressions;
Of turnpike pillars white and florid Are seen... Tverskaya gets along...
Of tyrant you didn’t fear, But now he your fate has had.
Of waters, forests and of hands Is master in the country borders;
Of what a languor’s full her breast?
Of what the secret book, she hid, In daughter’s bed till day was dreaming
Of whom they spoke till the end: N.N. is excellent a man.
‘Of whom your own lyre sighs?’ By you I’m often briskly questioned, -
Of words for songs of prairie districts...
Of world conventions breaking load Like he I lagged behind of fuss,

Of young delirium high rage.

Oh, don’t know dreadful dreams You, my young Svetlana
Oh, you, the husbands so honoured!

On day the third at early morning Tatyana saw and was adoring:
On earth, then might be by her love She’d joined the friends the day above!
One day to their isolation And for Tatyana they then bought:
Onegin.
Onegin at the first admission To agent of such secret mission
Onegin, friend of mine for years, Was born on Neva-river’s banks.
Onegin got Tatyana’s message. It quickly touched his soul’s strings:
Onegin had that room for living, In which his uncle lived on earth:
Onegin is deep sleep just having; The sun is now high in heaven,
Onegin my To sleep at home lone flied.
Onegin no love could hook in, But listened with a pompous look-in
Onegin now enters, For stalls comes over the feet,
Onegin quickly recognized The talk of love, which was fulfilling
Onegin’s coining with excuses.
Onegin’s fixing eyes upon; Where are compassions, perturbation?
Onegin’s life is somewhat sacred; And he, unfeeling, was to it
Onegin’s now free from care. In fashion has he cut his hair,
Onegin’s out by himself, He goes to redress himself.
Onegin’s pining, feels a smart, He seems to be consumption feeling.
Onegin’s quick to dress. Already His sernant’s ordered to be ready
Onegin’s sitting at the board By stealth is looking at the door.
Onegin’s soul always tries Unwittingly to show feeling
Onegin, standing up, At window it all read up.
Onegin stilly her is helping And in the corner is her laying
‘Onegin, then I was much younger And, seems to me, much more was fine,
Onegin was already ready With me some foreign lands to rate,
Onegin was as mute as dust, Tatyana pined for love in secret;
Onegin was in eyes of people, (Which were in judgements strict, not feeble,)
Onegin Who loved the youth with all his heart
One’s horned, with muzzle of a hound; Another has of cock the head;
One vision always, everywhere, The rime desire comes to dare

On river’s batik; and far away In front of it, all looking gay,
On roan horses, three abrest; Arid let’s have dinner before rest!
On saucers jam they gave, and seldom Some berry water in a jug Put on a table, and a cup.
On shaky bench, and own head To Tanya’s shoulder he bends;
On sledge the corpse, all icy, lone, He’s taking home dreadful hoard,

Prepared for the sake of money To sighs, to boredom and to fraud
Prepare ruins once for ever...
Presents his friend and distant kin.
Princess Helena has for ages The same of tulle well made night cap,
Princess is staring at him...
- Princess, mon ange! -
Princess, undone yet before him
Quite badly at unknown places, Accustomed to her chamber, fields.
Quite charming actresses, he is An honoured cityzen of links.
Quite egoistic, selfish, dry, To dreaming dedicated greatly
Quite greatly, when he made a visit, On her was fawning, you should see it!
Quite mutely for herself she keeps, Of them to nobody speaks.
Quite sad for me is your occurence, The spring, the spring! of love the time!
Ran up and not without fighting
Rather well The grove sleeps.
Recalling former love, such free, Perceptible and carefree,
Regards of them to you I’m giving.
Regret, resentment, being sorry, Some pure love to every boon,
Reliably well screwed the flint Is cocked once more.
Remembered, though with mistakes, Two little verses of Enaid’s.
Reminiscence of old time, Of maiden’s room!
Replace the fortune.
Report for him was so sudden From steward:
Reposes in heart contentment Like drunkard, spending night for payment,
Returned; without extra word always ready - shortly said.
Return him life by jealous flame Or otherwise the male offended,
Revealed his own soul simple, Meanwhile malevolance of people
Rooms are cold, In them some hungry but high-flown
Rousseau (I’d say as if bypassing), Of how dared pompous Grim
Ruslan’s, Lyudmila’s friends!
Sad and cold,
Says yes or no, never да-с Or нет-с’(the words, they all would pass).
‘Sed alia temporal’ But rudeness (Like dream of love, the prank of goodness)
Sees no use (and not in vain). But hearty pain to be abiding
Severe anguish, called a spleen, Was seeking in the world unquiet,
Severity instead of kindness; Indeed, for you was neither tidings
‘Shall go forth or should return?..
Shall I again your chorus hear?
Shall I portray in truthful picture Secluded study of the best,
Shall see emotional flight?
‘Shall we begin?’ ‘Perhaps,’ says Lensky.
She all is trembling, paling, shying.
She capital forgot at distance, Its lustre, all its noisy feasts;
She courted… at once decided: To Moscow by winter route!
She deathly pale was looking round And all her face was greatly sad
She doesn’t glare at the rest, And doesn’t claim to have success;
She doesn’t listen to the guests And curses their idle leisures,
She doesn’t say: ‘Let us postpone For multiplying price of own
She doesn’t see that day is breaking. She sits in bed with hanging head And on her letter isn’t pressing Her well cut out round stamp.
She doesn’t see yet any party Which could be helpful in the hook.
She enters a deserted yard.
She falls on snow - he is swifty: He’s taking her in paws and brings,
She feels herself like all her dear Of books beloved main persons feel:
She got afraid and in a hurry Tatyana tries away to fly
She had in hand: by fire heat That hero she was meeting.
She has been shuddered, but is mute, She eyes Onegin as some good,
She hears rings of glasses, hooping Like at the funeral great, long.
She hurries up to have a chat.
She kept accounts; always then On Saturdays they bath were serving,
She kept her manners quite the same, Was quiet bow her again.
She liked the books of Richardson Yet no because them all she read.
She likes the order, well-composed, Of oligarchial the chats,
She like the moon to shine has come Among the wives and maids the one.
She looks, and all her own heart More often’s heating and more hard.
She loved the fraud about fears Of Richardson and by Rousseau.
She makes her figure twine and twist, With quick her foot the foot she beats.
She near parents could bloom, Like lilies in the valley grow,
She-neighbour her to outshine, Herself is though dazzling, fine.
She never could caress inspire For parents; it all seemed wrong.
She now from the hill comes down, And hardly breathing looks around
She opened the feasts In it And praised devices of the chillness,
She ordered secretly her granny: Prepare table for a guest...
She parts with woman, house keeping, Behind the gates.
She runs for forest... he’s about; The flabby snow is knee-deep;
She’s after me.
She’s always bored by loud laughs By noise of their playful muffs.
She’s been embarrassed, cannot now Him understand yet anyhow;
She’s deaf for greetings of the friends; To hide her tears quickly bends
She’s dutiful and always modest, As fresh as morning, always gay,
She sees a hall forgotten now, A cue on billiard has a rest,
She sees: the room is light again, Through window’s a frosty pane
She’s getting up with rays of morning, At once she hurries to the fields
She sighs, assuming as her real Delights of others and the griefs;
She’s mere infant, But yet coquette! A giddy instance!
She’s not astonished, hasn’t anger...
She’s nothing ever entertaining, For life she wouldn’t give a hoot..
She spins; a friend of winter night The splinter’s crackling making light.
She’s playful, careless and gay, Well, just the same as every day.
She’s running - he is after her; She can’t be running any more,
She’s still and simple at a glimpse. She seemed to be a certain copy,
She’s stuffy here... In her dreams Transfers for life among the fields,
She’s taciturn like that Swetlana,.. When came, at window she sat.-
She stayed in frosty tone darkness: Young maiden is with Him at last.
She’s trembling in the heat of fever,	 For him she waits and doesn’t hear That in the garden maidens sing, While they are gathering, not seen, In bushes berries: they were given To sing strict order (while they job To make them banns not to rob As berries never could be eaten: In country they invented then The way the banns to defend!),
She’s trembling like persued a doe, Her darkening eyes she hides away
She’s troubled by the jealous trend: As if some cold foe’s hand
She’s up at once, Like shade she’s pale, but no answer...
She’s wild and sad, is daily silent. Like forest calf, she’s often frightened,
She’s writing, on the table leaning, And always Eugene’s kept in mind,
She thinks:
She tried her corset tight to wear, And Russian “н” in French best manner
She waited, looked and anyhow She said: well, yes! it must be He
She waits impatiently for feeling That hearty tremble now fades,
She was him asking: For long he's here? Where from?
She was the works in fields observing, She salted mushrooms, punished men,
She went and went.., All of a sudden Sees manor-house from a hill,
She went away.
Shortly each from other Were drifted they by thirst of blood.
Should I begin my freedom flight.
Sincerely, in grief embracing
Since young Tatyana at some hovel With Eugene, in my hazy dream,
Slipshod result of my pastimes,
Smoke From pipes to chimney flies.
Some balls, one children’s entertainment...
Some big and shaggy bear comes .. Tatyana: ‘Ah!’ But he becomes
Some boys In boat with its oars rowed Along the sleepy Neva’s stream,
Some cold wind just blows.
Some darkling blessing to invite To know better bliss of life
Some days was crying, then was trying To get divorce from newly man;
Some files of steel for nails, some combs, Some scissors, straight and wry: he owns
Some foreign words, she often writes.
Some frame and lace for working fit, In silk embroider never did.
Some grove, hamlet under hill, Behind the river sees a garden;
Some herds were walking in the scene, By garden canopies were ended,
Somehow, Without prefaces, just now, For hero of my book Let me attract attentive look:
Some kind of trouble was him teasing: For change of places secret cue
Some lively rots in long a tale Or hearty letters of young maid.
Some loss in all the song’s refrains: The song of cat is best for maids.
Some madridgal of old days, And presses hand; at once her face
Some meadows and fields extended; Somewhere villages were seen,
Some merry magpies Tanya sees, All mountains were smoothly covered
Some minutes they were silent both, Onegin then to her came up
Some neighbours said of the impression That wedding had some pointed time,
Some noise by beetle’s raised.
Some old ladies had been seated, All capped, with roses, looked wicked;
Some other...
Some other, cool and cold dreams. Some other, more severe issues
Some other now drew attention, Some other managed with invention
Some poet from ranks of army Signed verse of villaine, though charming.
Some real honour and the pride.
Some round dance away disperses: Behind the river smoked, blazed
Some scornful, cunning, idle ventures, - Your angry blame I grasp in haze.
Some several miles from Krasnogóry, From Lensky’s village, there lives
Some string of love in her appeared, In love affairs she was geared
Some sweetish torture of the glory His blood excited very soon.
Some tears shed at urn my early: ‘He tell in love with me,’ to thinks
Sometimes allured is for days: With love the Satan jokes makes.
Sometimes are troubling wit and heart: Without printing pretty mark
Sometimes could keep his answer dark; Sometimes a quarrel could enable
Sometimes he dares like in game, By smile of Olga animated,
Sometimes himself for tricks on others Was given lessons by the others;
Sometimes himself, not as a rule, Could he entrapped like real fool;
Sometimes in dream they all, whom dote, To soul mine arrived like guests:
Sometimes of him in midnight hazes, Untill yet Morpheus, she believes,
Sometimes Onegin was surprised, With what could mutely coincide;
Sometimes she beat a house-maid, - All that not asking man she made.
Sometimes she’s talkative or dumb, In secret gondola I’ll travel
Sometimes to Olga he is reading With morals novel for herself,
Sometimes, when he’s in bed yet sleeping, Some papers they are bringing him.
Sometimes will give you all the rate Of all your own real fate.
Sometimes with own blood she wrote To lady’s album if by chance,
Sometimes with pretty girl a meeting, A young and fresh unwaited kiss,
Somewhere you could look at me, But harmful is the North for me,
Some wines to me are not ajusted, Remind a lady-lover rusted,
Some words, yet stilly, tries to say, But at the table could she stay.
Some wrong and wry neglectful babble Of mispronouncing of words
Some youthful lover ran again Behind the fuss, but all in vain.
Still humble, deaf like long before, Still eats and drinks for two or more.
(Still previous happiness was feeling) To see my Moscow just kneeling
Stood Eugene, thoughtful, quite alone, As poet himself described.
Submissive to the natural passion Invite to them, become her friends,
Such acts insulted neighbours all, They stopped to come to him at all.
Such charming, tender.
Such custom’s known everywhere: To marry daughters every tried
Such dread! She wants to be away, In thickets of the woods to stay.
Such men (I’m first of them to blame) From boredom dear friends became,
Such subject’s worthy of your mind: More gentle never you will find.
Such time what can you do in village?
Surprises deeply all his reeling?
Tanya, near!
‘Tanya though!’ ‘D’you know her?-
Tatyana, ah, Tatyana dear!
Tatyana hadn’t any trends To play with them in any weather:
Tatyana hardly sighs, the man Addresses her with verse in hand
Tatyana has a dream unknown: As if she lone were to get
Tatyana heard with indignation All those gossips, but she had
Tatyana looks but isn't. soon To this world’s fuss she’s hatred feeling.
Tatyana now sighs and moans, The letter’s trembling on her palm, The wafer’s drying on her own Inflamed by fever rigid tongue.
Tatyana poor is in heat; in bed she never falls asleep;
Tatyana (Russian in her soul, Herself she doesn’t know why)
Tatyana’s flushing, all she’s trembling - To be to-day he promised me,- Vladimir answers, - may be, he For post now yet is waiting.- Tatyana stands, she drops her eyes As if reproached by the vice.
Tatyana silently curl lean, Her languid head she bent to him;
Tatyana’s interest is affected By melting on the fire wax:
Tatyana’s letter to Onegin.
Tatyana’s now trembling, seeing By what a thought, a note, feeling
Tatyana’s pale and dismal charms, Her hair down let by chance,
Tatyana steeps.
Tatyana, tell: for whom is it?
Tatyana took advice of nanny; As she in bath-room had to guess
Tatyana to the yard, such wide,
Tatyana tries to listen better To interests of the common clash;
Tatyana trusted legend’s fancies Of simple folk’s old times.
Tatyana was the name of sister... Such name we use to gratify
Tatyana with her eyes amazing A look at everything can take,
Tell again, You see, I’m now muddle-headed.
Thank God, more clearly - she’s feeling The man, for whom to sigh she had
Thanks God, had any wish to try; But at the life his look was wry.
That all the best and sacred wishes,	 And all the fresh and pure dreamings
That dream aroused her misgivings.
That Eugene and his friend Vladimir At dawn will argue their living
That gets away of cheecks the flaming.
That, giving balls three times a year, He squandered all he had at last.
That he at love such timid, tender Last evening joked like offender;
That hermit idle and despondent Yet recently in winter lived
That he’s the head - it all is clear And Tanya has much less of fear;
That instant I could trunk with reason
That on the days I meant above, At feet of ladies fox expression
That recently I was you christening?’
That she, delightless in the near, Is daily waiting just for him;
That she is good, dull husband knows But at has fate he curses throws,
That spring of youth could quickly speed (As I could joke until now)?
That’s what I am.
That’s why in French she’s always writing.
That their friendship never ends; By unreflected rays effected,
That there are by fate selected Of people dear sacred friends;
That time in sacramental valleys, At cries of swans, of spring endeavours,
That time to all my childish dreams
That time, when in lyceum’s gardens I flourished quickly, quite serene,
That uhlan, slave of lot his own, With her should come to regiment.
That uhlan’s loved by all her soul… At altar now does she stand
That under gale, en waves in boat All over the sea crossroad
That was the way of Eugene’s thinking.
That year pretty autumn weather Too long was staying on in yard,
That you had come, my dear vision In darkness came for head of bed
The afternoon he passes, ready Again to waste his day already.
The almanacs and all the journals In which to us they lectures give,
The ashes patriarchal honoured.
The aunts are winking one to other And pushed my Tanya quickly rather,
The autumn golden is coming, The nature’s now trembling, pale
The balconies; with lions gate, While on the crosses jackdaws reign.
The banks of stopped, unmoving river By shroud are equated here.
The bard of feasts, of languid sadness, you had chance to stay with me,
The barks, the smacks of kissing maids, The crush, the laugh, the noise are loud.
The bear drags behind and groans; In front of them she sees and moans:
The beds are made. And any guest
The boston, gossips were in vain, Or dear looks or sighs - all those
The boulevards, cossacks and the butts, Drug-stores and towers, the garments,
The boys got dogs behind the fence And took the maiden for defence.
The boy was frisky but with grace.
The branch has no wreath; Beneath, alone, grey and puny,
The breath is fading in her lips, She heard some noise, her eyes did glimpse...
The brigadier, a slave of God, Has peace by him forever got.
The bugs and fleas at stations lone Each minute take your sleep away.
The capital’s high pick was there, Of fashion patterns, the elite.
The caravan of crying geese For south fleeted. And unwaited
The chairs, saucepans and the trunks, The matresses and jams in jars,
The chief of rakes, a tribune-tippler. — Hut now simply good the head
The Christmas tide for joy is coming!
The clock’s been striking
The coachman’s on -box with lash In sheepskin coat and red sash.
The colonel sent it for the chance.
The cool debauchery was known As science of the love: its own
The cool of humble pride composed, Of ages medley and of ranks.
The corvee yoke changed for rate, And serfs were blessing their fate.
The crowd now all is waving, A whisper through the hall has flied...
The day had gone, but no answer...
The days were speeding; heated air Could mean: the spring is coining fine;
The depth of mist can it conceal, Of fate right law will it reveal
The door of coffin was unclosed: To have new wreath he got a chance;
The doubts all confused her soul:
The dreams: fir-trees, the hag, the bores, The East, the bear, snow-storms
The dreams, not bound with this day, The threats, the talkings and predictions,
The driven chairs noise arouse; All throng has rushed to anter-room
The drivers all themselves incite By clapping; each his master curses...
The drive to Moscow! It means the world to see!
The ‘else’s trends’, for you the best Among dull rhymers and the rest? -
THE END
The end of life; of loss confess With no hopes for regaining:
The enmity’s afraid in world Of eyes derisive, scornful word!
The evening darkness comes along...
The evening sky’s more dark.
The eyes are blue as depth of heavens, The smile, the flaxen curls of hairs,
The fate and life in their turn To their judgement could return.
The feather beds, the cocks in cages, The basins, pots, et cetera,
The field is dark in pretty gale...
The fire-place is fading...
The fire’s dead; and under ashes Like gold is the coal’s crust;
The first he made - he left you all;
The first in life the stormy passions, And they give birth to new impressions,
The first of leaflets just can show: Qu’ecrirez-vous sur ces tablettes;
The fisher’s fire.
The fixing time; the poor bard In silence drops his pistol hard
The foes!
The foes put the capes on steppe.
The folly’s wicked, giddy, needs Grand rubbish for the grand high persons;
The former foe of the orders, The waster, Eugene of the lands,
The frames were shaking, trembling there But nowadays the men, like fair
The fright of shame, of evil word? Where are you, cherished happy dreamings,
The frost is sparkling, we are glad To everyone of winter prank.
The frosty dust did not inhale, With early snow, as it happened,
The further I’m from youth my gay,
The gardens, chambers before me I could at once all gathered see!
The ghosts of unearthly whims, Of sacred poetry dreams?
The girl appeared! Laugh was wild!. They all stood gaping for a while,
The girls are jumping all around.
The grammar; language from abroad For mother tongue they all had got.
The greatest gossip, old cheat, The glutton, grafter, fool a bit.
The great prosperity lo waste - To have at home he intended:
The guessing songs and round dance, On all Whitsundays caught a chance,
The Gulnare’s singer imitating Across this Hellespont could swim:
The habits sugared all her woe Which wasn’t smoothed by any chance:
The hall is full of crowd; The music’s weary of sound;
The halls enormous is all then trembled, The parquet’s cracks wee heard again.
The hamlet, where Eugene’s boring, Is nice and cosy a nook,
The hawkers walk, gets up the salesman, Is dragging to cabstand a cabman,
The head of Chaldean wise men, — Of dreams the fortune-teller then.
The health, the prime of life, its sweetness, The smile, the innocent calm ease,-
The heart of somebody he’ll cherish, Arid, kept by touch of truthful fate,
The heat of hearts became all cool; Besides we were awaited both
The heaven’s bodies beam and shine. The bushes, chutes without bounds
The heirs of estate, all cross, Obscenely disputes try to force.
The herds make noise; of nightingale The song at silent night is gay.
The highways Russia will unite, Connect and cross its any side;
The honoured castle was erected Like all such castles: it was fine
The horse for rider proved obedience, The dinner rather well fastidious,
The inns are absent.
The jams, eternal talk of all: Of rain, of flax, of horses’ stall…’
The jumps, moustache, the clicks of heels Are all the same without changing
The killer of his brother-bard; The bard is dead... and that is hard,
The kin from distant places rare Have tender welcome everywhere,
The knight of freedom and of right, In case like this he wasn’t right.
The ladies sit at fire-place; You see in corners whispering maids;.
The ladies tried to her to near; The old women smiled on her;
The languid wit forever smiles; The heart is still, its never dashing,
The lanterns, children, many shops, A palace, gardens, cloisters, flocks
The less we love a pretty woman, The easier she’s liking us,
The letter’s ready, has been fit...
The lilt, well known round me: Reveilles vous, belle endormie.
The love’s foregone, the muse appeared, And clearer my mind became,
The love, the plants, the void, the village, The fields! to you I’m staunch a friend.
The love; who cooled it with divorcement, By scandal enmity could strand,
The maidens tried to pass by quiet In front of tier through hall; and higher
The man, by muses once affected, As usual frowns alt the day.
The master’s gone God knows where, Tracks are wrong.
The memory of bard, yet youthful, Will sink into oblivion truthful,
The men all bowed her more eager And tried to catch the eyes of her.
The men confront. All cross in peace. The throng, all humming, takes the seats.
The mistress cries, ‘At last you’ve got!’
The modern taste of his attire, To keep your curious gaze,
The monument in words explains Submissive sinner, Dimitry Larin,
The moon, this miracle in heavens, To which we dedicated nights
The more to light the darkness fits. In vain for fields she’s now looking:
The morning pleasant noise arose.
The movings, voice, the figure fine, All Olga has... but you can find
Themselves to show making booms, To gleam, to charm, to fly to troops.
Then all they grandly went away, As if they spent a business day.
Then bring to Doonya some guitar,
Then changed in strict and quick a mode The maiden’s names by names from France,
The neighbour... order to your guy: Not say a word he must be ready, By no means to call my name!’… -To whom, my dear?
Then for the babbles due concession To hear of her heart confession
Then gets he out of the yard, At home falls asleep too quickly,
Then he for her a chair’s finding, They speak about this and that,
Then hoofs, wry trunks, it let alone The tufted tails, the fangs in mugs,
The night has many stars, all charming; The brightest one at heaven’s blue
The nightingales, of spring the lovers, At night all sing: dog-rose flowers;
The night is frosty, skies are clear, Of all the heaven’s bodies light
The night then comes, the moon is mooving Around distant parts of sky;
Then let the poet enraged To play the fool: at his teenage
Then life almighty brings the good: A pompous bloom arid costly fruit,
The noise, the laughter, running, bows, Mazurka, gallop, waltz.
The noisy talks he was escaping; All their prudent talk, such raving,
The novel’s pages of my either, At will that name well sanctify.
The novels were for many years Her inner life, were liked by her;
The novelty with ages smacks.
Then sudden caper - and she fleets Like down from Eolus marching,
Then supper... time to be in bed, And soon the guests all home get.
Then they estimated Each one another; daily forth
Then took the friends for last his track Arid each of them the pistol had.
The nurse was using own way To help the girl with cross and pray.
Then we’ll submissively obey To hear stories by the way
The old man had no time To read the books of other kind.
The old woman was admired By that advice, such simple, good;
The one was Eugene in these deserts, Who could evaluate his gifts.
The panes with patterns are like marvel, By snow flocks are covered trees,
The Pans of the district girls, With Olga Petushkóv then whirls,
The peaceful life with him and you, Who pictured Finnish frosts anew.
The persons, known everywhere, And wanted fools for trampling feet.
The pilgrim young, you know why, Should long ago home fly.
The pistols all are now shining, The hammer’s jingling at the lock,
The plates and covers jointly clatter, The glasses clink, all filled with wine.
The poet in heat of judgement Some nothern poem could cite,
The poet, the thoughtful dreamer Was killed by hand of friend for nought!
The portraits of the tsars on walls, And motley tiles on stoves.
The powder, by grey parts handed, On shelf is falling; an indented,
The prince as if anew him sees:
The reapers dip the jars for best Arid pleasant clear water daily.
There is a place not tar from house In which inspired bard could rouse.
‘There is my crony, he said, To warm yourself you must be trying!’
The rest all gathered at the hail: Of ball the beuaty shines for all.
The rime on frosty days yet sunlit; And sledges; and before the sunset
The ringing voice of Olga, though, From Larin’s soon forever went:
The sadness, gladness, love inflaming They all were ready to reveal.
The same, from whom he now keeps A letter, where heart her speaks,
The same is dog, the same’s her man Which is of club the loyal number,
The same I was in time of wisdom,
The same yet girl, whom he in whim Neglected then like meek for wisdom?
The seasons country views
The secret drives in sledge rehearse; But I am ready to endure
The secrets of the bed of marriage, The garlands of the sweetest love
The shade of coming storm this way Is darkening all the breaking day.
The shades of night are now rare And Vesper’s met by cock ahead.
The shepherd’s singing as before And makes bast sandal more and more.
The shining skies are now blued.
The sledge for race is now ready, In it he’s flying to the mill;
The sleigh has stopped; to auntie old, Consumptive now, to behold
The smile of lips, the move of eyes To catch by loving eyes somewhere;
The snow-drift at once is moving...
The snowflakes are flashing, whirl, Like stars at river’s banks they fall.
The snow’s crackling... someone’s near... On her tiptoe fast she flies
The snow’s rose shining charm; On Christmas evenings hazy calm.
The spring enlightened him, and now From dosed chambers he gets out,
The spring of honour, idol last!
The spring to country all you calls, The time of work, of fruits, of warmth,
The spurs of horse-guards-man are jingling, Each foot of pretty ladies flies,
The storm has breathed; his prime such charming
The surely we may her min Among the nets of tempting fuss.
The sweet prosperity and freedom; I read a little, sleep for long,
The talkative my lyre’s tired To glorify all haughty ranks.
The talks are saved for time much better: The mouths chew, From every side
The tears of the people’s awe. Katenin there could restore
The tea’s been brought; the quiet maidens Are taking saucers into hand,
The thirst demands some more of drinking To cool hot cutlet’s fat at once,
The time for strolles, much inspired, And all seductive, tempting nights.
The time is fast, she must be out: For her are waiting so long
The time of day by tea or dinner, Or supper.
The time revengeful now nears, In secret Eugene gaily sneers,
The time was coming, dull and hard: November stood in front of yard.
The tracks of tears; in a chair In front of heroine in grief
The veil on hat she turns away, And superficially is reading
The vice, that’s gentle but not feeble, In novels now celebrates.
The waltz is whirling; noisy, taintless, A couple after couple flies.
The waters Are still.
The way is short, from dear neighbour They go home fast, at speed;
The way to keep her man away! And everything became o’key.
The whiskers and the bloody tongues, The horns and fingers made of bone -
The winter had been longed by nature, In January it snowed hard.
The wiser I should get each day: My deeds and rhymes to have corrected,
The wish of heart to whisper her.
The withering of own days, Which can’t revive by any ways?
The woman says:
The world said: why, He is a clever, pretty guy.
The world will me forget, but you My charming girl, will ever you
The world with smile my muse was electing, The first success lent wings for us,
They all are family the same, The sons of greedy bore at game.
They all began to guess of reasons, Invented stealthily decisions,
They all can find her somewhat queer Provincial and affected creature
They all kibitkas brim-full load. All men and women raise a boom.
They all replaced for each of roberts; The tea’s been brought.
The yard was under snow dense: Parterres, roofs and all the fence;
They are alone far from people, Are playing at the board of chess,
They argue louder; he’s getting Some long a knife; in short a while
The yawnings, other cold things He never saw in any dreams.
They bark and laugh, they whistle, clap, They sing and speak, like horses stamp:
They bless the harmful ruts of land And ditches of the fatherland.
They bring Tatyana to grand meeting The tightness, agitation, heat,
They call, And no reason, even gappy, You have for not to come at all.-
They’d better laugh before they had
They didn’t use the word a beauty To call her, but from head to foot
They don’t cost yet neither sense, Nor any songs, by them inspired:
They don’t listen to, they cry, They argue, laugh and squeak in fright.
They friends became.
They had a fasting twice a year, They liked of round swing high gear,
They had invited several maids With never smiling, sullen face;
They harness them in sleighs for road. The breakfast’s ready in the room.
They joked, not without sin At Tanya’s suitor made a hint.
They kept in peaceful life some customs Of dear old days; it means:
They laugh; the guests are now coming.
They met each other, riding horse, And then became unseparated.
They nowhere turned to her Lornettes of jealous ladies dear
They now play the eighth of roberts, Of whist the braves; eight times in line
The young scapegrace was so deeming, When he by post-chaise in dust
The youthful years would be fading, The soul’s heat would not be hot
They rush into the yard at once!
They sat. The aging sleigh is sliding, Is stilly crawling through the gate.
They say, they’d got For that the best in world reward.
They say, you are a lone guy, In country’s stillness you are boring.
They scared love quite timid, shy., But they attracted lovers by
They see encircled by its grove Petrovsky castle.
They speak to him of no more, But being bachelor is bore;
They take away the chairs, plates, Them call, they give the friends a place.
They’ve made me marry other man; And I’ll be true to him till end!
They were at Shrove-day accustomed To have the fattest Russian blins;
They were some secret good traditions Of tender, shady old age:
They whisper her, You, Doonya, see!
This kind of book yet doesn’t show The writer’s fancies in a row,
This news Tatyana quickly hears.
This noise, the lustre and the crooks, For wild a garden, shelves of books,
This Russian family seems light, To all the guests it’s always zealous,
This thoughtful, interesting creation By travelling merchant them was brought
This way my Eugene was her teaching.
Three houses will wait for him.
Through all her fate, severe, ruling. This crank, this dangerous and a gloomy
Through grass is snaking, green and purple, Through linden trees for river’s crook.
Through kitchen-garden they went home; They came together; no one
Through magic crystal I could not Myself discern all their lot.
Through nose singingly could say, But soon her mood could pass away:
Through roar of fiddles never thrives The jealous whisper of styled wives.
Through tears never seeing him,
Through thickened crowd of the guests, Or handkerchief picks up with jests.
Through tight a row of the grandeurs, Of diplomats, of army dandies,
Thus you, Yazykov, always wrote In gust of passion of your heart,
To aim unseen at forehead pale, At distance try to make him silent.
To all he seems to be some strange; In front of him the faces range
To all of kin the dinners row They take my Tanya every day
To all these letters, tears, deeds...
To answer her.
To ask you: leave, do not be funny. You know, in your heart I find
To barrels go bullets hiding; First time is clicking pistol’s cock.
To be Napoleon each wishes, But millions of the two-legged creatures
To be the rest of year free Congratulations are accustomed;
To be with you I cannot go...
To bring her features clear, plain, Simplicity of country maid
To brush his nails in front of him, Eloquent madcap, wasn’t grasping.
To call Anisya children go, To take the keys from porch they ran;
To call some people gets away.
To challenge you could try like hell? But in your soul can you tell
To chase the love and all at once To get agreed a secret meeting,
To come to tables hand in hand.
To comfort sorrow and grief.
To conic again to have a look And there lone read some book.
To country, people in the groves, To isolated dear nook
To cry, to weep I’m now ready...’ -I see, you are unwell already
To-day frivolous generation Matures, stirs, already tests
To-day they wish to make each lady To read in Russian.
To dissipate her greatest woe	 Judicious husband had a go:
To doctors he is being sent. The doctors him to waters send.
To each grandparent to show Her lazyness dispersed for days.
To Eugene sent his hearty greetings: Some hints on nearness he gave.
To fix her fate it’s time, I see;
Together for a time they sit.
Together go and with him To take the box with fighting thing.
To get him up she isn’t asking, Not taking eyes off all his head
To go on with calm a talk, To fix at you the joyful stare!..
To grammar will subdue us all, To verse will pay too much attention:
To grasp that time he had a chance, But as a student he’s a dunce.
To grieve, to talk of new affairs, To laugh, to gossip for a while,
To guess the windy youth is trying
To have a breakfast three together Could make them quickly reconcile,
To have a rest and have a hike, That’s why I’ll finish other time.
To have a talk with her he tried
To have half-Russian neighbour dear; As quickly as he can appear
To have remorse I haven’t forces; Like Bogdanovich’s all verses I’d like all dear gallicisrns, As well as previous youthful sins.
To have some quick and restless fancy? Because her will and wit has had
To her is drinking first, his rhyme He gives to Tanya at that time.
To her it all seemed rather queer, She all forgot, replaced again
To her they gave a little ring, An old song began to sing:
To her was due first dream unquiet Of poet: at love the drive,
To him among the lines all printed His eyes in spirit always hinted
To him for tree, mysterious rather: Forbidden fruit to have you’d like, Or Eden to itself’s unlike.
To him occurs A stubborn, rude idea though,
To him she doesn’t pay attention, You strive or die, it is the same:
To honest people he belongs: This way the century reforms!
To hostess a lady’s heading, Some plump grand general’s behind.
To inner porch he goes fast, He’s laying down her at last.
To it headlong in simple coach Onegin now has sped up
To jokes mixtured with the bile, To epigrams with no smile.
To journalists I put at mercy Of labour mine some real fruit.
To judgings by the world severe
To keep the happy stirrup dare...
-To Larin’s -’Oh, looks it strangely: To kill your pretty evenings daily…
To leave the world I would he sorry.
To Lensky he could listen smiling.
To Lensky speaking of himself, Revealing all his heart itself,
To lesson yours attended I, To-day, you see, the turn is mine.
To look at life like at the rite, And follow the decent crowd,
To loose his colour he’s beginning: She doesn’t see or she’s too hard!?
To make the friends embroiled become, Made friends to barrier to come;
To make your dear magic tuning Of beauty’s passion mood, resuming
Tomb-stone is gloomy, Is lost, and last of feet the prints
To me alone could he bring His dawn of life, such sad and stormy!’
To meet a student while departing, Or scholar wearing night cap.
To meet princess.
To meet the scholar world’s desire I could describe, you’d be amazed.
To me I met sometimes in them! E sempre bene, gentlemen! (37)
‘To me, Onegin, all this splendour, This tinsel of repelling life,
To me that time you were quite right,’ To you is grateful soul mine...
To me true compass now lend
‘To me you wrote, Do not deny.
To-morrow we’ll Tanya show...
To Moscow, they need good things.’..,
To object of his love and hymns, To beauty dear, nicely languid.
Too long by ballets I was pressed, By Didle too I am depressed».
Too long the silence’s now seeming...
Too many neighbours we have had, I cannot count al! them yet.-
To other things let’s make approach: For ballet we shall hurry up.
To part Eke friend, but real, eager.
To pensiveness she got accustomed From cradle to the present day,
To Petushkóv she never goes; Pykhtín, the hussar, toed to fuse
To play by her untwisted lock, To kiss the edge of Olga’s frock.
To play the cards was used with me.
- To pour half-glass you do a favour...
To protests of soul’s voice, Suppressed his yawning by his laughing.
To queer dreams did not abandon, From mob apart was never standing,
To read Apuleius I was ardent, But Cicero I didn’t read,
To read... but thoughts yet make him wonder His heart is sad but doesn’t slumber,
To rescue, to his hones - peace In grave, in mother-soil at ease!’
To reverence for singing that; The poet, such great but shying.
To ride a horse in steppe severe?
To scratch unfaithful icy path As he’s afraid to fall at last.
To see it here even poor I cannot; does it bother us?)
To see you more to have a chance. To follow you everywhere;
To show his beloved main person As perfect one for all the times,
To silent room of bard, alarms And wakens Lensky by appealing:
To sit with him all day and night, Not stepping out of his sight.
To such an album, being tight, If to confess, I’d like to write,
To take it up she can’t, in fear Of bear: he about hangs;
To Talon’s surely he’s raiding. Kaverin there is awaiting.
To tell her something of the rest; Misgivings hardly squeezed her breast.
To tell you all, what he had known, I haven’t any time at all.
To their talks pays none attention, In them she sees yet nothing smart,
To them He paid his all attention then.
To them, to their senseless feasts She brought her fine and dear gifts,
To tiresome this drive, all failing, An hour or two they gave;
To touch in splendid admiration.
To trust his wife he was light-hearted, In dressing-gown ate and drank.
To try to find in Russia whole Of them three pairs straight and fine.
To try to keep the indignation Her bps, such stubborn, now want!
To twenty six of own age. Was weary at leisure one
To us: from it we have not more Than mincing manners to adore.
To village own took her soon; But she was often in a fume,
To walk?
To what a storm of sudden sensing At heart he now has to duck!
To what malicious merry-making, It may be, give a cause for you!
To whom in secret you did write Some verse, your sins to justify,
‘To whom in throng of jealous girls You dedicated tune of hers?’
To whom my vice is not a harm?
To whom your hearts were dedicating,- In written Russian they were bad
To write about otherself As if about ownself?
To you	give with my endeavours And bows.
To you I’ll give my service; forward You keep on mind my speech to you;
To you I’m greatful!
Triquet gets up; the whole meeting The deepest silence now’s keeping.
Triumphant is and gladly shines, Is boring me, makes suffer torments
Turned off, then yawned and said at once:
Two bullets - fitting at this rate - Will quickly settle all his fate.
Two neighbours, home have been walking And all about her are talking.
Two pines accreted by one root, Beneath are streaming snakes of brook
Two pistols in a row,
Two poles glued by halves of floe (Disastrous, trembling little aid)
Unbearable is at rout Of mere dinners see a line
“Uncle is in bed, His breath again began to harden, To see his nephew he’d be glad”.
Uneasily she was expressing Her thoughts in mother tongue expressive;
(Unhappily, too much all salted). But. with the help of resin bottled,
Unknown in the thick of grass To bees, to moths at no paths.
Unlucky Larina was going (To waste the money was afraid)
Unlucky victim, Lensky’s gone...
Unmoving, lone he’s again.
Unmovingly he lay, and queer Was heavy brow’s languid peace.
Until his breget sleepless, fine Will strike the bells for him to dine.
Unwaited coming any day And each delay to get away.
Unwillingly, with sighs of pity: He’s blessed, who knew all their pretty
Unwittingly in mirror’s peeping Ashamed to recognize: he’s beaten;
Unwittingly may bore by image Of its monotonous naked hues.
Unwittingly, you see, the lives Confuse yet me with incarnation;
Upholsterers inspected, painted Renewed the old closed sleighs.
Up marble footsteps he has flown, With hand has mended hair fast.
Upstairs to the highest rate.

Visantine tubes with amber, treasures Of bronze and porcelain of the past;
Vladimir answered short, was dry. Then he was mute, his face was wry.
Vladimir could have odes written, - To road them Olga never got.
Vladimir has the book to close; He takes a pen: his verse has got
‘Vladimir Lensky here’s lain, He met his death like man quite hold
Was able any glimpse of sweetness, Of vergin years bias giftness
Was always punished wicked vice, And good was given garlands twice.
Was asking Olya him at once
Was brave instead of ‘elle Nina’ To put the ‘belle Tatiana’
Was he, the youth, a singer gloomy By fatal treachery confused?
Was his emotional speech. Black curls his shoulders could reach.
Was impudent and shy; sometimes Could show how tear shines,
Was languishing and taciturn, Eloquent ardently in turn;
Was lost in thought; to Olga near Revengeful words said no more.
Was not astonished at the dawn To see him coining to his hall;
Was pedant, judging of the cloth, We’ll call him dandy for the forth.
Was seeming new on each occasion, With jokes innocence amazed.
Was shaking. Due to Zues he’s being The heir of all relatives in trust.
Was she feeling; That he then really was moved,
Was talking much of them with pride.
Was teaching him with ready jest, With morals never was severe,
Was terribly unsatisfied. With every man at any side
Was too afraid, I must confess...
Was victim of the wild misleading Of big his passions unrestrained.
Way is endless To bed from ballet; half asleep
We all to learn had little go And anyhow something got,
We all were taken by the dreams, As if young life anew begins.
We easily betrayed her daily And she was cheating all of us;
We haven’t any decent road, Forgotten bridges all decay.
We knew the game of passion’s oath; By life were anguished as a rule;
We’ll be like invalid in hut, Who nears ears to confessions
‘Well, dear me, what is the matter?
Well dressed, she’s waiting for her chance, But came to Olga her adorer.,.
Well have the music regimental!
‘Well, he is killed’,- the neighbour said.
Well, his example gives a lesson; But, goodness me, it’s quite distressing
‘Well... I, my nanny… don’t know... For love I’m longing, dear me!
Well, I remember... has he gone?
Well, I saluted classicism! It’s late, but preface has been seen.
‘Well, let us go…’ Prince then nears His own wife (and she them hears),
Well, many trifles like the bra.
Well, may he all it is by now The fraud of innocent young girl
‘Well, no, just the same...
Well, she had found charming secret In sense of horror by itself:
Well, to present you I shall try’
We must all time all them caress, Respect and love at heart, not less;
We must meanwhile
Were full of liberty his views And soul. Ardent, somewhat queer
Were in the dimmish light of moon Embraced, were weeping at the tomb.
Were lilted with passions, lazy fidgets, With dreams of thoughtful soul’s haze.
We sing of their lucky fate And glory!
We them remind about us...
What?
What are you: angel guardian trusty Or tempter treacherous and ghastly?
What a whim...
‘What big is Tanya!
What blunder! I’m a punished ranger.
What chatters!.. Blood in her runs cold...
What does next day for me prepare?
What does she see? that at the boards Are sitting spooks of any sorts:
What does the kinsfolk mean namely?
What do you want to ask, you say!
Whatever are you, dear reader, A friend or not, I’d like with you
What foolish, dumpy is this place!
What for to grieve?
What for would ever view
What for yet here has he been?
‘What for you early disappeared?’
What for you visited all us?
What Grandison? Ah, Grandison!
What happened, what a strange a dreamt
What has been moved inside of him, In soul lazy, cool, delightless?
What is your name? - He’s looking on, At last he answers: - Aghaphon…
What joy: to-day we’ll have to dance!
What kind’s he now anyhow?
What languid agitation current There is in blood and soul mine!
What languid is her gaze guile charming:
What more you want?
What purpose?
What roses, you can be judging,
-What said the satirist, remember!
What shall I do, I can’t foresee; The same she says to all but sharper:
‘What’s happened?’- `Nothing’… - Gets away.
What’s he? is real imitation From Moscow a spook or whim
‘What slow-witted you are, nyanya!’ -I’m old, dear friend of heart, My wit is now fading, Tanya: But long ago I was smart: By word of barin’s will I’d rather…-
What’s my Onegin?
What’s the end?
What’s use?
What was the sequence of the meeting?
‘What way?
What will he choose for his engagement?
What would you feel if by your pistol Were killed a friend such good and young
What would you feel if still, unmoving Your friend on earth is mute at rest
‘What, you are married! didn’t know!
When clouds in the sky are drifting And stars in turn all get away,
When he’s at home, always there By Olga is he kept all day.
When him a schoolboy clips the wing, Or like a little hare’s trembling
When in the garden’s alley fine The fate us brought together; sadly
When I to wretchers was assisting Or by the prayer was releasing From stress my soul within me.
When sees: a hunter from afar At him is looking so far,
When she recovered she is looking: Some inner porch... the bear's gone;
When some respiended dear lady To give in quatro me yet tries,
When suddenly from village rear He could some droshky’s sounds hear),
When to the porch to part all went. At parting all they fussed about
When we for better education Will widen more all needed frames
When we get that fellow, When we see him, instantly
When well have cooled the passions temper And no more they would alarm
When we shall gather under banner Of stillness, rational and cairn,
Where are of stormy love his itchings, The thirst for knowledge and for work,
‘Where are, where are withdrawn you now The golden days of life my prime?
Where is it better?
Where is that sullen gloomy crank, The killer of the bard such feeble?’
Where’s agitation And honourable aspiration
Where we have never been.
Which are half-funny and half-mournful,
Which by the girl-friends had been scribbling From start, from end in any twig.
Which came from neighbouring a valley; The peasants come to take a rest,
Which doesn’t pity any things, In front of which the life yet is
Which friend of yours with smile of terror In circles decent, so right,
Which pressed his spirits all the way And kept his laziness for day, -
(Which seemed to be like this and that) Me captivating; and for that
Which seemed to be more tender, rich; And with the trustful blind entreaty
Which’s shiny, windy and alive, But selfish, idle, thirsts for thrive.
Which they are calling spleen in English, In Russian known as khandra.
Which they in world of London grant To speak like vulgar, (but I can’t...
Which was for him from time of childhood Like work and torment, was delightful,
While at the moon Tatyana’s looking, By own heart away she’s gone...
While he prefered to play a steed. His finger’s frozen a little,
While looking after girls, and yet At them keep strictly your lornette!
While people yawn in church at prayer, To find a bunch of praying grass
While she’s by tinsel gown waving In front of her some throng to hail;
‘Whith Olga what could happen?
Who carefully us can cherish?
Who father’s money never trusts To cunning friends, to crufty cards,
Who glory, money and the ranks In turn and quietly effected,
Who grandly tries but mere rambling To prove the people: eggs is eggs?
Who has ideas and is living, He looks at people with disdain,
Who hates the moving and the word When you translate him their meaning;
Who helps from slander not to perish?
Who isn’t bored to be dissembling, To tell the same who never ends?
Who killed at duel friend his own, Had lived without aim, this sage,
Who left Tambóv without hindrance, He wears glasses, brown wig.
Who listens to the same objections And bans the thoughts of wrong reflections
Who loves you more than I can do Must here write a verse anew.
Who made his life not cooled, but useful, With years could his aims abide;
Whom don’t bore the falseful fears, The prayers, swears, threats and hints,
‘Who might be thinking... all the time!
Whom you’d be trusting?
Who never bores us by his charm?
Who pleased her soul and the mind, Much more was touching all her feeling:
Who’s always proud of himself, Of dinner and of wife herself.
Whose author bolter nature’s feeling Than Chateaubriand does himself.
’Whose glance, exciting inspiration, With sweet caress gave best reward
Whose grateful, feeling, truthful hand Will pat the fame of old man!
Whose knowledge makes his heart all cool Arid him forbids to play the foolt
Who’s he?
Who’s helpfully for us adjusting His own deeds and when he prays,
Who’s that, which never us betrays?
Who’s there, crimson beret wears, With Spanish diplomat she speaks?’,
Who’s waiting for her husband sadly Alone daily all her life.
Who understood it wee a hit, All his attention paid to it.
Who was unmodest, who by bristle. An answer, other trifles done,
Who wrote comedies with joy; With glory Didla’s crowned there.
Why not? It’s pleasant and sonorous; With it, I know, always goes
Why! out of the country thickets...’
Will be like Melmoth? patriotic? Cosmopolite? or has he got it?
Will get some favourable deal, And afterwards they’ll not endure
Will never tremble their hand To beat the slander off a man;
Will pass away more fast, they tell, And you will pass the winter well.
Will show my renowned face And say: ‘It’s poet of grace!’
Will take the twilight of my days.
With age the life is such a badness...’
With age to argue is unfitness; The custom’s despot of the males.
With all her cooling beauty lone Did like the Russian winter fine:
With all my soul being sure That any rubbish, done with zeal,
(With all that I began my thought). But when he reached it in a hurry,
With all the fame of red high heels, With grand, magestic old wigs.
With autumn skies were dayly breathing, Not every day the sun was gleaming,
With blood sustained each pure hand... They’d bel.ter part in friendly manner...
With brilliant Voronskaya Nina, Of Nova Cleopatra this.
With care steps on icy brim And slips, and falls; all fluffy, merry
With charms untroubled she is sweet; For long at table does she sit
With clear soul
With dangerous book alone’s hiking, In it reveals she so striking
With dear muse of mine capricious Let’s hear forest’s noise delicious
With dear Tanya he was eager Himself to show honest man,
With dreams and heart of old days In her this time again could raise.
With education, as you know, We all can shine, and bless it God!
With fire in the drooping eyes, Unwittingly she slightly smiles.
With fizz by bottle wine be pouring While saying clever pncky word -
With flocks of snow; through the crowns Of naked birches from the sky
With fragrant, all grey-haired head An old man said old jokes,
With friend a pistol fight to launch, To aim at temple or at haunch.
With gloomy brow under hat, Who arms cross-folded has had.
With goat’s beard sits a hag; She sees sceleton stiff and proud,
With grievous noise became all naked, The tog was falling on the fields,
With hard emotion yet tender I am enjoyed by breath such gentle
With heavenly her pride she’s touching The earth when conies to take a rest:
With her he’s ever in her chamber Until the daylight turns more fainter;
With her, my lips will find anew Petrarka’s language ‘I love you’ .
With him be keeping, and the sledge To park in field not far from hedge.
With him my cousin first Buyánov, All fuzzy, wears peaky cap,
With him was always on the bends: His enemies as well as friends
With his malicious evil wit, Who boils in action for a bit.
With his she-wolf, in hunger bold, A wolf is coming to the way;
With joy he knew: for wedding carriage Two weeks ahead was fixed above.
With jug young woman goes fast, By feet she crushes snow-dust.
With Kharlikóv Panfíl and children Monsieur Triquet arrived, a wit,
With kin to meet
With Lea, that’s given him too sweety; With ladies’ flatness; tunes of men;
With love friends’ notions I’d rate
With lyre, while abroad residing, In Goethe’s, Shiner’s places hiking,
With many senses all this fuss, Which is antique for all of us.
With medal for Ochakov playing, Intended Olga for my wife
With might and main he’ll you defend With love of kinsman, not of friend!
With mill Zaretsky has been dealing: Mill-stones he investigates.
With more bow can be meeting, Sometimes at all him isn’t seeing;
With my request immodest, gladless I’d trouble you for helping me:
With narrow and long wine-glasses, Reminding slander waist of yours,
With Olga Tanya; quickly rather Onegin Olga took for dance.
With one of feet the floor she’s touching, With other slowly she wheels,
Without answer.
Without breath, with timid feeling Tatyana listened then to him.
Without fail you’ll find them here: Two hearts, the blooms, the torch’s rays;
Without gold can revive While simple product is its richness:
Without jokes By bore and rhyme depressed, all day
Without me his time will come, But now let him live in calm
Without mincing style was shining, But interrupted was meanwhile
Without prejudice considers The others oils but us as ones.
Without purpose or a spite Would not repeat for days in error;
Without service, wife or deed, By something to engage unfit.
Without them Onegm’s pictured.
With own heavy hall, his dear; Gvozdín, Buyánov, Petushkóv
With own wife that’s very portly Came stout Pustyakov at last;
With Ozerov all were delighted, Semyonova with him divided
With passion and the wit to gain, For sudden tenderness to wait,
With Pelagéya Nikolávna The same’s monsieur, her Fine-Mouche, friend,
With pride for recent fame can glow: Napoleon waited but in vain
With ranks of books his shelf fulfilling, For long he eagerly was reading,
With reason I remembered them.
With Russian hammer and the might Return to sleighs the foreign image;
With scornful bitter contemplation Your proud look will me refuse!
With secret grief I read this matter, While reading cannot put aside.
With short a word or with a cross, With question sign and so forth.
With talks about novel hazy; With symbol, making sisters crazy;
With Tanya Lensky; Kharlikóva, The bride of more than ripening age,
With tender soul, clear sense Him gave attractive handsome face,
With the berries laughingly, Don’t hear secretly
With thirst of soul all them held; And she discovered other world.
With threat Onegin raised his hand And wildly with his eyes is shining;
With throng by passions deeply fusing, I brought my playful muse to fit
With time I’d smooth and then might be I’d find a friend to suit my soul, Would be a loyal wife on whole, And virtuous mother I would be.
With unaccountable charms He sees his Olga in his arms...
With unexpected consolation Unwittingly some thought of that:
With utterly regretful soul, On granit leaning, straight. upright,
With war; with magazine’s white lie; With snow and with own wife,
With waves I wished myself somehow To touch her dear feet by mouth.
With what a lively fascination Deludes herself with all deceits!
With which to start?
With whom we all to sleep had gone; - For tender girl, the dreamer hearty,
With wreath, ashamed, his hand in hand, With drooping head, as if yet lone,
With yawn I’ll cover disrespect And shall of bygone recollect?
With you I now tears shed;
With youthful years gets away, And my Zaretsky, I would say,
Would bore, eat, drink, be ill, he fat, At last in own bed ideal
Would come, she innocently grieves, Her languid eyes to moon she raises;
Would come together at week-ends, Unceremonious dear friends,

- Yes and no yet.
Yes, I shall come, I’ll come!’ - before
Yes, It is he...
Yes! just indifferent oblivion Behind the grave for all us waits.
Yet being child, at any year Tatyana didn’t play with doll;
Yet being child, in children’s throng To play and jump had none desire,
Yet, being chilled, are striking horses, Annoyed by harness; near light
Yet child, by Olga fascinated, Ignorant yet of hearty pains,
Yet Cupids, devils and the serpents Make noise and hop in front of pit;
Yet does it whirl the world and us:
Yet limpid is the near wood
Yet long ago did I look For words in Academic Book.
Yet might be less fulfilled for while By foreign words without pressing,
Yet outside, as well’s inside, The lanterns everywhere shine;
Yet some of weary men-servants At entrance on fur-coals sleep;
Yet someone hisses, feet are stamping, Some blow nose, cough, are clapping;
Yet speaks of Him; and she avoids The sounds of the tender voice

You all indifferent, lucky, prone Of Levshin school the pupils, fans,
You all my slipshod stanzas here: For recollections restless dear;
You all, whom decorated guickly Tolstoy with brush such wondrous, sweatily,
You alone Among anxieties in still
You are guessing To know; you are quite exact:
You are in heat.- - But I’m not ill Well... nanny, I’m in love, I feel.., - God bless you now, dear daughter! -
You are like comrade, 1 believe, To help are ready always gently,
You are, my Moscow, beloved of Russia daughter, and where can we find some other of the kind..
You came to me when I was sleeping, Unseen you were to me beloved,
You came two times, but then of self You don’t make them yet reminding
You, constant vivid job, could harden My slender force, to me could give
You, country Priams, should be ready; And you, each sensitive a lady:
You’d better hurry up away. The shepherd at the break of day
You didn’t like me; What has happened, That after me you now are?
You don’t let be cooled my soul, Become embittered, hardened, dry,
You don’t want? - check up your cost, Or grudge, or drink, and thus the evening
You, dreams, my dreams, where is your pleasure And rhyme to it: my youth, my treasure ?
You first of alt must love yourself, My dear venerable reader!
You get along the Neva’s route, Newborn by me the work of fancy;
You give a pen and paper, dear, I’ll stay in bed; make table near;
You had, I saw, some little pity, Some small respect to age, at least...
You hear voice of little source, You see grave-stone small and coarce
You help my doubts to resolve:
You leave your city big, audacious, In which the winter’s mirth you’d had.
You let me now my ideas To tell you all this very day.
You lie, young hard, in peace all age!’
You listen but without anger: With time young girl will change her temper,
You listen to my grievous call:
You’ll fall in love once more and find… You learn to rule yourself: I fear
You’ll find some vowes to the dear To love her until dying days.
You’ll hardly meet to-day a maiden With Russian magazine in hand.
You’ll perish, but before you go, You try in dazzling pretty hope
You’ll see: they all become the bosh
You make my sleepy heart revive, To my good nook more often dive.
You may become a man of business And think of beauty of the nails.
You, Moscow, I thought of you!
You must remember that day time,
‘You, nanny, let me stay forlone.
You never stamped your small foot-prints. You liked smooth carperts of some prints
Young ladies on the floor all glide But yet in towns, countryside
Young triumphant peasant On wooden sledge renews the way.
You now bless long years’ work
You now come to rooms, the inner...
‘You now meet...’ - And both coolly, The enemies, not aiming yet,
You poets, are queer!’ -Good bye, Onegin, time has gone.
Your glance made languish me far love, Your voice was touching all my feeling For long... But that was not a dreamt You came, at once I got to know: Inflamed and heated I was whole.
Your pricks of swear, you must know, Your strict and cool severe chat
Your tears, if you will be crying, Would never touch my gloomy heart,
You see, by skies its predestined:
‘You see, Tatyana’s not a child,’ The old woman’s voice is mild,-
You see, your Larina is plain, But very dear old soul;
‘You send your grandchild stilly there To give this note to... to my...
You sigh not speaking of your will: When will the devil come for him!’
You take my set of florid rhymes
- You tell me, nanny,
‘You tell me, prince, if don’t mind,
You tell, of them which is Tatyana?’ -That girl, which’s always so sad;
‘You tell of those Your old times... I’ve boring tide..’
You write the odes, gentlemen,
Zaretsky cautiously could lay
Zaretsky’s bitten both lips; To Lensky Eugene then appeals:
Zaretsky thirty second step Has measured with exactness cared
Zaretsky to behave refuses: ‘But where is the second yours?’
Zaretsky was explains refusing; To stay for long he didn’t want:
Zarétsky, brawler; they believe: Of gambling gang he was the chief,
Zhizhi, my soul’s crystal first, The subject of naive my passes,
Zhookovsky
